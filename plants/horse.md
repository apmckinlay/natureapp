Horsetails are one of the oldest plants on earth, reproducing by spore rather than seed. They can be found in or near wetland areas such as marshes, rivers, and streams throughout North America.

Brown jointed **stems** with spore-containing cones on top emerge in **early spring**. The stems turn green once the spores have been released in **late spring/early summer** and narrow green **leaves** sprout all round each of the nodes. The mature plants resemble bottlebrushes.

**Did you know?** Horsetail stems are coated with abrasive silicates and can be used to scrub pots or polish woodwork.
