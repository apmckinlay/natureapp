Wild Bergamot are a member of the Mint family. Their pinkish-lavender **flowers** look like ragged pompoms at the top of 2-5 ft stems. They flower from **June** to **September** in dryer areas, on waste lands, and woodland borders throughout most of the United States and Canada.

Wild Bergamot send up multiple leafy **stems** in a tight cluster, giving the plants a bushy appearance. The stems are square and gray-green. The hairy **leaves** have jagged edges and are 1-3 in long.

Wild Bergamot are a favorite of bees and butterflies, but herbivores usually avoid them as the oregano-mint flavored leaves can cause indigestion.

**Did you know?** The Indigenous peoples of North America had many medicinal uses for Wild Bergamot, from curing headaches to relieving the symptoms of colds and fevers.
