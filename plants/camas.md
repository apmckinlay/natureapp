Camas have spikes of blue **flowers** at the end of tall (12-28 in) stalks with clusters of grass-like **leaves** (4-24 in) at the base of the plant. They carpet moist grassy slopes and meadows at lower elevations and flower from **April** to **June**.

Blue Camas are widespread in the **Pacific Northwest**. Other species can be found in the western and southeastern United States. Color may vary from white to purple.

**Could it be?** **Smooth Camas** (White Camas) and **Death Camas** (Mountain Death Camas), found in western North America, are unrelated and poisonous. **Smooth Camas** have white flowers with a green heart at the base of each flower and are slightly poisonous. **Death Camas** have similar flowers but grow at higher altitudes and are very poisonous.

**Did you know?** [Elk](/animals/elk/), Deer, and [Moose](/animals/moose/) graze on Camas leaves, while gophers have been known to nibble on the bulbs and then move them to a different area.
