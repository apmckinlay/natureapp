Camas has spikes of blue **flowers** at the end of tall (12-28 in) stalks with clusters of grass-like **leaves** (4-24 in) at the base of the plant. It carpets moist grassy slopes and meadows at lower elevations and flowers from **April** to **June**.

Blue Camas is widespread in the **Pacific Northwest**. Other species can be found in the western and southeastern United States. Color may vary from white to purple.

**Smooth Camas** (White Camas) and **Death Camas** (Mountain Death Camas), found in western North America, are unrelated and poisonous. **Smooth Camas** has white flowers with a green heart at the base of each flower and is slightly poisonous. **Death Camas** has similar flowers but grows at higher altitudes and is very poisonous.

**Did you know?** Camas bulbs (when well cooked) were a staple food for Pacific Northwest First Nations. Elk, deer, and moose graze on the leaves, while gophers have been known to nibble on the bulbs and then move them to a different area.
