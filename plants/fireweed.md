Fireweed  is a **tall**, single-stemmed plant (4-9 ft) with long, narrow **leaves** (up to 8 in long) and a tall spike of 50 or more pink to purple **flowers**. The flowers wither quickly and are replaced by long, narrow, purplish-red **pods** containing 300-500 seeds. The **seeds**, with their tuft of white hair, are readily picked up by the wind when the pod splits open.

Fireweed flowers from **June** to **September** in open meadows, along streams or roads and forest edges. It can be found in all parts of Canada and the United States except for the southern states close to the Gulf of Mexico.

**Did you know?** Fireweed is one of the first plants to appear after a fire or in clearcuts. It is common in Alaska and northern Canada.
