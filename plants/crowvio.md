Crowfoot Violet is a small plant (3-6 in high) growing in **grasslands** and **open woods**. It can be found across Canada's prairie provinces and Ontario as well as in the central United States. The **leaves** are 1-3 in long and deeply divided so that there appear to be several smaller leaves.

The Crowfoot Violet flowers from **mid-** to **late spring**. The 3 lower petals of the light purple **flowers** (.75 in across) have white beards. The lowest petal is spurred.

**Did you know?** The Crowfoot Violet is also known as the Larkspur Violet because its deeply divided leaves resemble those of the delphinium or larkspur, whereas most violet leaves are heart-shaped.
