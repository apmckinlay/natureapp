Western Skunk Cabbage is a **foul-smelling** plant that grows in damp areas (edges of streams, marshy areas) in the Pacific Northwest. 

Unlike Eastern Skunk Cabbage, the long, shiny, green **leaves** appear before the flowers, growing to a height of 1-2 ft. Western Skunk Cabbage flowers from March to May, producing a stalk of tiny, tightly-packed, yellow-green **flowers** surrounded by a bright yellow, hood-like bract. The flowers later turn into reddish-brown **berries**.

**Did you know?** Western Skunk Cabbage grows slowly, forming dense patches that may survive for up to 80 years.
