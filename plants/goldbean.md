Clusters of golden-yellow, pea-type **flowers** appear on Golden Beans from **mid-May** to **early June**. The plants are 5-20 in tall and branching with clusters of 3 dark green **leaflets** as well as 2 large leaflets at the base of each stalk. Later in the year, you'll spot the grayish-brown, curved, flattened **seed pods**. Both the flowers and seeds are poisonous.

Golden Beans often form **large patches** due to running rootstock. They are most commonly found on the western prairies, but some varieties can be found in open aspen forests or meadows in the foothills of the mountains.

**Did you know?** Indigenous peoples of North America used the flowers to make a yellow dye.
