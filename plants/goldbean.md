Clusters of golden-yellow, pea-type **flowers** appear on the Golden Bean from **mid-May** to **early June**. The plant is 5-20 in tall and branching with clusters of 3 dark green **leaflets** as well as 2 large leaflets at the base of each stalk. Later in the year, you'll spot the grayish-brown, curved, flattened **seed pods**. Both the flowers and seeds are poisonous.

Golden Bean often forms **large patches** due to running rootstock. It is most commonly found on the western prairies, but some varieties can be found in open aspen forests or meadows in the foothills of the mountains.

**Did you know?** First Nations people used the flowers to make a yellow dye.
