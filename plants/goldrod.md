You know that summer will soon be over when the Goldenrod flowers appear. Goldenrod has clusters of bright yellow **flowers** (shaped like a spike or a pyramid) at the top of a tall **stalk** with long, narrow green **leaves**. The plant’s height varies from a few inches to over 6 ft, but 2-3 ft is common.

Goldenrod grows across North America.

**Did you know?** Goldenrod doesn’t cause hay fever as the pollen is slightly sticky and can’t blow on the wind.
