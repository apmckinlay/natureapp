Bog Rosemarys are **low**, **sprawling**, **evergreen** shrubs (8 in-2.5 ft) with narrow, leathery blue-green **leaves** that roll under (1-2 in long). They have drooping clusters of white or pink bell-shaped **flowers** (.25 in) that bloom in **late May** or **early June**.

Bog Rosemarys grow in acid bogs across Canada, Alaska, Washington, Idaho, and the northeastern United States.

**Could it be?** Bog Rosemary leaves have a sharp tip, while the leaves of **Bog Sheep Laurels** are a little wider and not as pointed. [Labrador Tea](/plants/labtea/) has wider leaves with hairy twigs and a pungent smell when crushed.

**Did you know?** Bog Rosemarys have perfumed flowers designed to attract pollinators. However, they're not dependent on seeds to reproduce as they also spread through underground rootstock and runners.
