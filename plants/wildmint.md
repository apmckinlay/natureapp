You may smell Wild Mint before you spot it, especially if you brush past the plant and bruise the leaves. Wild Mint is 6-24 in tall with pairs of jagged oval **leaves** (up to 2Â½ in long, 1 in wide) opposite each other along the square hairy **stem**. Clusters of small, bell-like pink to purple **flowers** circle the stem above the leaves.

Wild Mint can be found across North America from Alaska in the north to Texas in the south. It flowers from **July** to **September**.

**Did you know?** Flies and wasps visit the flowers for nectar. However, the mint oil's anti-bacterial properties may cause indigestion in cattle and livestock.
