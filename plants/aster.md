Aster displays clusters of small, daisy-like **flowers** in **late summer** or **early fall**. The **pale-blue to purple** ray florets (petals) branch out from a round yellow cluster of disc florets. The plants range in height from 1-4 ft and are found in **grassy** and **damp** areas.

Many North American plants are commonly known as **Aster**; the height, flower color, and shape of leaves will vary depending on the variety.

**Did you know?** Recent research indicates that most of the asters growing in North America are not native but have been introduced from Europe or Asia.
