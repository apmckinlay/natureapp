Clumps of Cattail are a common feature at the edge of marshes, ponds, and ditches throughout North America. The tall sturdy **stalk** (3-5 ft) is topped by a **brown**, **cigar-shaped head** (3-6 in).

The **pale-green upper portion** of the spike contains the male flowers and usually breaks off. The thicker **brown portion** contains the female flowers. Once the flowers are fertilized, they develop into fluffy seeds that blow away in a breeze. The plant has long straplike **leaves**.

Cattails play an important role in purifying and removing pollutants from bodies of water. They also form an important habitat for birds, insects, amphibians, and fish.

**Did you know?** The Indigenous peoples of North America wove Cattail leaves into mats, hats, and even capes. The fluffy seed heads were used to stuff mattresses or to absorb moisture in diapers.
