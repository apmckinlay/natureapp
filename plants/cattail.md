Clumps of Cattail are a common feature at the edge of marshes, ponds, and ditches throughout North America. The tall sturdy **stalk** (3-5 ft) is topped by a **brown**, **cigar-shaped head** (3-6 in).

The **pale-green upper portion** of the spike contains the male flowers and usually breaks off. The thicker **brown portion** contains the female flowers. Once the flowers are fertilized, they develop into fluffy seeds that blow away in a breeze. The plant has long straplike leaves.

Cattails play an important role in purifying and removing pollutants from bodies of water. They also form an important habitat for birds, insects, amphibians, and fish.

**Did you know?** Various parts of the Cattail are edible (rhizomes, corms, flowers, lower parts of leaves, pollen) and the fluffy seeds can be used as insulation in clothing, bedding, and life jackets.
