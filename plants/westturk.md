12 different plants are commonly called Beargrass, so it can get confusing. Western Turkeybeard (xerophyllum tenax) is found just **below the treeline** in the northwestern mountain ranges from British Columbia south to California and east to Alberta, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

A single, erect **stem** (20-60 in) grows from a large clump of curving, grass-like **leaves** (20-24 in) at the base of the plant. It flowers from **June** to **August**, producing a cone of small, star-like white flowers that develops into a bottlebrush shape as it matures.

**Eastern Turkeybeard**, only found in the southeastern United States, is a smaller plant with smaller flowers.  **Sacahuista** (Nolina Microcarpa), also known as Beargrass, grows in the dry deserts of Arizona, New Mexico, and southwestern Utah.

**Did you know?** Western Turkeybeard flowers may have a lilac-like perfume.
