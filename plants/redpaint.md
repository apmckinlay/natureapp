Red Paintbrushes produce clusters of spiky, bright red or orange-yellow blooms at the tip of the stems. The **flowers** themselves are hard to spot; it's the bracts that are brightly colored.

Many different varieties of Red Paintbrushes can be found throughout North America. Height varies from 6 in to 3 ft, depending on the species. The plants often form clusters of individual, erect **stems**. The **leaves** are long, narrow, and pointed.

Red Paintbrushes can be found in prairies, open woodlands, and along the banks of streams throughout western North America. They flower from **April** to **July**.

**Did you know?** Red Paintbrushes have green leaves and produce their own food, but they also join roots with neighboring plants to steal water and nutrients.
