Solomon’s Seal (not to be confused with False Solomon’s Seal) can be found in **moist**, woodland areas throughout the eastern and midwestern United States and Canada.

Large oval **leaves** (2-6 in) zigzag up the long, arching **stem** (1-3 ft). The leaves resemble those of Yellow Lady’s Slipper, and it may be hard to tell them apart if the plant isn’t flowering.

The plant flowers from **late spring** to **early summer** with pairs of greenish-white, tube-shaped **flowers** dangling from the junction of leaves and stem. The green **berries** turn dark blue-violet when ripe.

**Did you know?** False Solomon’s Seal has similar leaves, but the flower clusters develop at the tip of the stem, the flowers are small and star-like, and the berries are golden.
