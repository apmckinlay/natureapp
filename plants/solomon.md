Solomon's Seals (not to be confused with [False Solomon's Seals](/plants/falsesol/)) can be found in **moist**, woodland areas throughout the eastern and midwestern United States and Canada.

Large oval **leaves** (2-6 in) zigzag up the long, arching **stems** (1-3 ft). The leaves resemble those of [Yellow Lady's Slippers](/plants/yellslip/), and it may be hard to tell them apart if the plants aren't flowering.

The plants flower from **late spring** to **early summer** with pairs of greenish-white, tube-shaped **flowers** dangling from the junctions of leaves and stems. The green **berries** turn dark blue-violet when ripe.

**Did you know?** [False Solomon's Seals](/plants/falsesol/) have similar leaves, but the flower clusters develop at the tip of the stems, the flowers are small and star-like, and the berries are golden.
