Marsh Marigolds' shiny yellow, saucer-shaped **flowers** brighten up shallow wetlands across Canada and much of the United States in **spring** and **early summer**. The name is somewhat confusing as the flowers resemble buttercups, not marigolds. The flowers are pollinated by a variety of species including flies, bees, and ants.

The mound-shaped plants (8-24 in) have glossy green, heart-shaped **leaves**. The **seed pods** split open when ripe. Spongy tissue keeps the seeds afloat until they reach a location where they can grow.

Handling Marsh Marigolds can cause skin irritation. They should never be eaten raw.

**Did you know?** The petal tips reflect ultraviolet light while the bases absorb it, directing insects such as bees, whose eyes detect ultraviolet light, to the nectar at the centre of the flower.
