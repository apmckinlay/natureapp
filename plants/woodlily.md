The Wood Lily is a familiar sight on the grasslands and open woodlands of Canada and much of the United States. It flowers from **June** to **August** with groups of 1-3 bright orange **flowers** perched on top of a tall straight **stem** (up to 3 ft). The goblet-shaped flowers have 6 petals with purplish-brown spots at their base. Long, slender **leaves** alternate at the bottom of the stem and circle around it near the top

The **flowers** are cross-pollinated by large butterflies (Swallowtail, Monarch, Great Spangled Fritillary) as well as Ruby-throated Hummingbird and hummingbird moths. Deer eat the leaves while voles enjoy eating the corms.

**Did you know?** Tiger Lily is a garden plant with similar flowers. However, Tiger Lily flowers dangle while Wood Lily flowers are erect. Tiger Lily also has small black bulblets where the leaves meet the stem.
