Gaillardia is a medium-sized plant (2-4 ft) with multiple individual **flower** stalks. Yellow, orange-red, or bi-colored ray florets surround a reddish-brown central disc (1.5-3 in across). Each ray floret has 3 lobes or prongs. Long **leaves** are arranged alternately along the hairy **stem**.

Gaillardia is found in **dry**, **sunny** spots (such as roadsides) throughout western Canada, central and northwestern United States. It flowers from **May** to **September**. Related varieties of Gaillardia are found throughout North America.

[Black-eyed Susan](/plants/blackesus) has similar flowers, but they are yellow and the ray florets arenâ€™t divided into 3 prongs.

**Did you know?** Butterflies, bees, and beetles are attracted to the flowers for food, rest, and shelter. Goldfinch enjoy the seeds.
