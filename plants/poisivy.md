Poison Ivy, as its name indicates, contains a poisonous resin. Touching any part of the plant can cause a reaction, including itchiness and blisters. It can be found in all parts of Canada and the United States apart from Newfoundland and California. It is commonly found at forest edges or clearings as well as along fences, roads, or railway lines.

Poison Ivy’s **leaves** consist of 3 almond-shaped, pointed leaflets ("leaves of three, let it be") that are red in the spring, green in summer, and yellow, orange, or red in the fall. The middle leaflet has a longer stalk than the two side ones. The leaflets can have either notched or smooth edges.

Poison Ivy can grow as a **shrub** or as a **vine**, attaching itself firmly to a tree or post. Clusters of cream-colored **flowers** can be seen in June/July, turning to waxy, pale-colored **berries** in September.

**Did you know?** The poisonous resin helps the plant to retain water and was not designed as a defensive measure.
