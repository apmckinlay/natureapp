The Northern Bog Violet can be found across Canada and the United States at the edge of ponds or bogs, in wet ditches, or along streams. The large, deep violet **flowers** (Â¾ in across) are on long stems well above the leaves. The plant flowers from **May** to **July** and is 5-10 in tall. There is a cluster of heart-shaped **leaves** (up to 4 in wide) at the base of the plant.

The three-part seed capsule splits open when ripe, spilling out masses of small **seeds**.

The [Early Blue Violet](/plants/earlyviolet) looks very similar but is shorter, has smaller leaves, and grows in drier areas.

**Did you know?** The flowers of the Northern Bog Violet are sometimes white.
