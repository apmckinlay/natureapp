Black-eyed Susans have large (up to 3 in across) **flowers** with 10-20 **yellow** petals around a flat, dark brown centre. They have **hairy** leaves and stems (10-30 in). Native to the western plains, they have spread and are now common throughout North America. You'll find them flowering all summer long in open, sunny locations.

**Could it be?** [Gaillardias](/plants/gaillard/) are similar to Black-eyed Susans, but their petals are bicolored (yellow and pinkish-orange) around a reddish-brown central disc and each petal is notched and divided into 3 prongs. **Gloriosa Daisies**, garden flowers, are related to Black-eyed Susans but have larger orange, red, or bicolor flowers.

**Did you know?** Butterflies, bees, and other pollinators are attracted to the flowers and birds enjoy the seed heads in winter.
