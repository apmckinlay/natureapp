If youâ€™re hiking through a **pine forest** in the Canadian Rockies at higher elevations from **May** to **July**, you may see a Calypso Orchid. The single, showy **flower** on a long purple **stem** (4-8 in) can also be found in **damp forests** or **bogs** of eastern North America.

The Calypso Orchid does not grow well if disturbed and has been reduced to small colonies in remote locations.

The **purple petals** and sepals spread out above a **slipper-shaped pouch** that is white with purple streaks and a yellow beard decorated with purple dots. The flower has a pleasant, vanilla-like **perfume**. A single, large, dark-green **leaf** appears in autumn at the base of the plant.

**Did you know?** North America has about 250 native orchids, but many of them are rare or endangered.The Calypso Orchid is one of the most beautiful.
