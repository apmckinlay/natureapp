If you're hiking through a **pine forest** in the Canadian Rockies at higher elevations from **May** to **July**, you may spot Calypso Orchids. The single, showy **flowers** on long purple **stems** (4-8 in) can also be found in **damp forests** or **bogs** of eastern North America.

Calypso Orchids do not grow well if disturbed and have been reduced to small colonies in remote locations.

The **purple petals** and sepals spread out above a **slipper-shaped pouch** that is white with purple streaks and a yellow beard decorated with purple dots. The flowers have a pleasant, vanilla-like **perfume**. A single, large, dark-green **leaf** appears in autumn at the base of the plants.

**Did you know?** North America has about 250 native orchids, but many of them are rare or endangered. Calypso Orchids are one of the most beautiful.
