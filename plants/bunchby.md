Bunchberry are **low** plants (4-8 in) that usually grow in a **thick carpet** due to their creeping underground stems. The prominently veined evergreen **leaves** circle the stem. The small green flowers at the centre of four white petal-like bracts (.5-1 in) develop into a tight cluster of scarlet-red **berries** in August.

Bunchberry belong to the same plant family as [Pacific Dogwoods](/trees/pacdog/) and have similar leaves and flowers. They are common in shady, cool, moist woodlands, especially **coniferous forests**.

**Did you know?** Bunchberry attract butterflies, and the berries are much appreciated by wildlife.
