Bunchberry is a **low** plant (4-8 in) that usually grows in a **thick carpet** due to its creeping underground stems. The prominently veined evergreen **leaves** circle the stem. The small green flowers at the centre of four white petal-like bracts (1/2-1 in) develop into a tight cluster of scarlet-red **berries** in August.  

Bunchberry belongs to the same plant family as Pacific Dogwood and has similar leaves and flowers. It is common in shady, cool, moist woodlands, especially **coniferous forests**.

**Did you know?** The berries are much appreciated by wildlife, but humans find them bland and they contain a large stone.
