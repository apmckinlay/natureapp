Bunchberry is a **low** plant (4-8 in) that usually grows in a **thick carpet** due to its creeping underground stems. The prominently veined evergreen **leaves** circle the stem. The small green flowers at the centre of four white petal-like bracts (.5-1 in) develop into a tight cluster of scarlet-red **berries** in August.

Bunchberry belongs to the same plant family as [Pacific Dogwood](/trees/pacdog/) and has similar leaves and flowers. It is common in shady, cool, moist woodlands, especially **coniferous forests**.

**Did you know?** Bunchberry attracts butterflies, and the berries are much appreciated by wildlife.
