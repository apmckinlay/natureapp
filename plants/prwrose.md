In early summer, Prickly Wild Rose shrubs (8 in-4ft) across North America are covered with fragrant saucer-like **flowers**. The flowers have 5 petals and vary in color from pale pink to red. By late summer, the flowers will have become **rose hips**. The stems are usually covered in **prickles**. The dark green, serrated **leaflets** grow in groups of 3-9.

**Could it be?** **Common Wild Rose** or **Wood Rose** is also native to North America, but it doesn't have prickly stems and is less common.

**Did you know?** The strongly scented flowers attract birds and butterflies and are very popular with bees.
