Plains Prickly Pear Cactus forms a **low mound** (1-2 ft tall) of flat, green, fleshy, **oval pads** with clusters of large needle-like **spines** and small hair-like **prickles**. The bright yellow, papery **flowers** have several layers of petals. The petals often have an apricot tinge and may fade to dusty red. 

Plains Prickly Pear Cactus can be found in dry grasslands, badlands, and eroded areas from British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan south to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. 

The **fruit** are small (1-2 in long) and oval, ranging in colour from yellowish-green to red or purple, and are filled with flat, disc-shaped **seeds**. The fruit (tuna) and pads are edible and for sale in southern regions of the United States.

**Did you know?** Many wildlife species, including Pronghorn, Deer, and Box Turtles eat the fruit and pads. The cactus provides protection and cover for small mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects.
