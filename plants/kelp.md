Kelps are large **seaweeds** growing in underwater forests. Balls of spaghetti-like strands hold the seaweeds to the rocky sea bottom. **Leaf-like structures** called blades are attached to the stems, and gas-filled bladders keep kelp blades close to the surface. Kelps grow very quickly (6-10 in per day) but have a lifespan of only 200 days. The Kelps you spot on the shore are old and decaying.

Kelps often grow in dense **kelp forests** that provide food and shelter to over 800 marine animals and thousands of invertebrates. The greatest diversity of kelp forests are found from southern California to Alaska, but they are a common feature of all shallow oceans. When they grow close to land, they protect the shore from erosion by decreasing the impact of the waves.

The blades/leaves of **Bull Kelps** (northern California to Alaska) are attached to gas-filled balls that float on the surface of the water. 
**Giant Kelps** are the most common species of Kelp in southern California with blades (leaves) up to 200 ft long. 

**Did you know?** Although there are similarities, Kelps are not plants. Seaweeds are algae, simple-bodied organisms that have combined with a bacteria containing a light-producing pigment that produces energy.
