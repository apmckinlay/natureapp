Kelp is a large **seaweed** growing in underwater forests. Balls of spaghetti-like strands hold the seaweed to the rocky sea bottom. **Leaf-like structures** called blades are attached to the stem, and gas-filled bladders keep kelp blades close to the surface.

Kelp often grows in dense **kelp forests** that are home to over 800 marine animals and thousands of invertebrates. The greatest diversity of kelp forests are found from southern California to Alaska, but they are a common feature of all shallow oceans. 

**Giant Kelp** is the most common species of Kelp in southern California with blades (leaves) up to 200 ft long. The blades/leaves of **Bull Kelp** (northern California to Alaska) are attached to a gas-filled ball that floats on the surface of the water.

**Did you know?** Kelp is edible and rich in iodine, calcium, and other minerals.
