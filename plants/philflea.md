[Philadelphia Fleabane](/plants/philflea/) has tall, hairy, single **stems** (.5-3 ft) with clusters of small, daisy-like flowers at the top of the stem. The white to pink **flowers** are .5-.75 in across with up to 100 thread-like petals surrounding a yellow disc. They flower from **May** to **June**. The flowers form fluffy **seed heads**. Hairy **leaves** are found at the base of the plant as well as along the stem.

[Philadelphia Fleabane](/plants/philflea/) grows best in sunny, moist conditions and can be found along roadsides, in fields, and in open woodlands across Canada and the United States.

[Tufted Fleabane](/plants/tuftflea/) is shorter than [Philadelphia Fleabane](/plants/philflea/) with 1-3 larger flowers. Fleabane blooms earlier than [Aster](/plants/aster/) and has more petals.

**Did you know?** The name may refer to the fact that people used to believe Fleabane repelled fleas. Or it may refer to the seeds, which are as small as fleas.
