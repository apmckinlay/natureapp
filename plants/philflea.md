Philadelphia Fleabanes have tall, hairy, single **stems** (.5-3 ft) with clusters of small, daisy-like flowers at the top of the stems. The white to pink **flowers** are .5-.75 in across with up to 100 thread-like petals surrounding a yellow disc. They flower from **May** to **June**. The flowers form fluffy **seed heads**. Hairy **leaves** are found at the base of the plant as well as along the stems.

Philadelphia Fleabanes grow best in sunny, moist conditions and can be found along roadsides, in fields, and in open woodlands across Canada and the United States.

**Could it be?** [Tufted Fleabanes](/plants/tuftflea/) are shorter than Philadelphia Fleabanes with 1-3 larger flowers. Fleabanes bloom earlier than [Asters](/plants/aster/) and have more petals.

**Did you know?** The name may refer to the fact that people used to believe Fleabanes repelled fleas. Or it may refer to the seeds, which are as small as fleas.
