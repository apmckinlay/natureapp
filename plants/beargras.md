**Common Beargrass** (Xerophyllum Tenax) are found in clumps on mountain slopes and forested areas from sea level to just below the tree line from British Columbia south to California and east to Alberta, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

A single, erect stem (20-60 in) grows from a large clump of curving, grass-like **leaves** (20-24 in) at the base of the plants. They flower from **June to August**, producing a cone of small, star-like white **flowers** that develops into a bottlebrush shape as it matures. The flowers may have a lilac-like perfume.

**Could it be?** There are a number of other plants that are also referred to as Beargrass. **Eastern Turkeybeards**, only found in the southeastern United States, are smallers plant with smaller flowers.  Several other species can be found in the southwestern United States and Florida, such as **Sacahuistas** that grow in the dry deserts of Arizona, New Mexico, and southwestern Utah.

**Did you know?** Indigenous peoples in the Pacific Northwest frequently used Beargrass leaves to weave baskets.
