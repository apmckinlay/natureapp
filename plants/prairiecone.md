Prairie Coneflower’s **tall cone** (up to 1 ½ in) of dark tubular florets is surrounded at its base by 4-12 **backward-bending**, **yellow-orange petals**. It’s easy to understand why it’s also known as Mexican Hat and Thimbleflower. 

The plant flowers from **July** to **September** along the sides of roads or in dry grassland areas throughout western Canada, Ontario, and the west-central United States. 

Prairie Coneflower is 10-24 in tall with multiple stiff, grooved **stems**. The **leaves** are deeply divided and up to 6 in long.

**Did you know?** The mature seed head smells like licorice or anise when crushed.
