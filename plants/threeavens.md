Three-flowered Avens are small **hairy** plants (4-16 in) with 3 nodding, reddish-pink, bell-like **flowers** on long stalks. Fern-like dark green **leaves** grow from the base of the plants.

Three-flowered Avens often grow in large patches. They can be found on the prairies and sagebrush plains of western North America and flower from **May** to **June**.

The purple-gray **seed heads** are composed of long (1.5 in) feathery strands and looks like feather dusters - hence the plants' alternate names of **Prairie Smoke** and **Old Man's Whiskers**.

**Did you know?** Three-flowered Avens are an important source of food for insects coming out of hibernation as they flower in early spring.
