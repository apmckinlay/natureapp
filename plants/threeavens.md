Three-flowered Avens is a small **hairy** plant (4-16 in) with 3 nodding, reddish-pink, bell-like **flowers** on long stalks. Fern-like dark green **leaves** grow from the base of the plant. 

Three-flowered Avens often grows in large patches. It can be found on the prairies and sagebrush plains of western North America and flowers from **May** to **June**. 

The purple-gray **seed head** is composed of long (1 ½ in) feathery strands and looks like a feather duster - hence the plant’s alternate names of Prairie Smoke and Old Man’s Whiskers.

**Did you know?** Three-flowered Avens is an important source of food for insects coming out of hibernation as it flowers in early spring.
