[Pincushion Cactus](/plants/pincac/) is a **round** or cylindrical cactus with tiny hairlike **prickles** or **spines** at the top of each cone-like bump. There are over 400 different species of [Pincushion Cactus](/plants/pincac/), which are **usually small** (6-8 in) but can be up to 3 ft tall. There may be a single **stem** or a large cluster.

[Pincushion Cactus](/plants/pincac/) usually flowers shortly after it has rained. The **flowers** have daisy-like petals pointing upwards like a funnel and range in color from white to red and occasionally yellow. The **fruit** is typically small, red, and elongated like a tiny pepper.

[Pincushion Cactus](/plants/pincac/) grows well in hot, dry, sandy, or rocky places from southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba to the southwestern United States.

**Did you know?** Sharp spines offer protection. Soft, dense spines shield the cactus from the hot sun.
