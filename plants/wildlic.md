Wild Licorice grows near water in moist, well-drained sites in grasslands and foothills. A spike-like cluster of narrow pea-like yellowish-white **flowers** with an erect upper petal can be seen in **June** and **July**. 

The plant is 12-40 in tall and **leaves** are composed of 11-19 long oval leaflets (1 in) on short branches. The flowers turn into oblong brown **seed pods** covered with long hooked prickles.

**Did you know?** The thick root is edible and has a sweet, licorice flavor. Roasting improves the flavor, but it should only be eaten in moderation, especially by people with high blood pressure or liver disease.
