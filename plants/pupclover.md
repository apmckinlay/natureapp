Purple Prairie Clover is 1-3 ft tall with a cluster of stems bearing cylindrical flower heads (1.5-2.5 in long). Despite their name, they aren't a true clover. The first purple **flowers** appear at the base of the flower head and then progress upwards. The **leaves** are 2-5 in long and made up of 3-7 very narrow leaflets.

Purple Prairie Clover flowers from **June** to **August** and can be found across the Canadian prairies and the midwestern United States.

**Did you know?** Purple Prairie Clover is edible. The seeds are high in protein and appreciated by many animals. Small rodents may help distribute the seeds by carrying them to their dens.
