[Wild Strawberry](/plants/wildstraw/) is better known for its tiny, very flavorful red **fruit** which ripen in early summer. The low-lying plant is only 4-7 in tall with clusters of 3 dark-green, serrated **leaflets**. The small white **flowers** have 5 petals around a centre of yellow stamens.

[Wild Strawberry](/plants/wildstraw/) can be found in grasslands and open forested areas throughout North America. It can often be found in patches as it spreads by sending out runners to form new plants.

**Did you know?** The small seeds on the surface of the strawberry are the actual fruit. The red berry is just a receptacle for the seeds.
