Prairie Onion has a distinctive onion smell and  is most commonly found in Canada’s prairie provinces and the central United States. It grows in dry sandy or rocky grassland or desert areas. 

Umbrella-shaped clusters of 15-30 small white bell-shaped **flowers** (¼ in long) bloom from **May** to **July** at the top of a 4-10 in stalk. One or two narrow **leaves** appear before the flowers. Later in the season, you’ll find capsules of 4-6 **seeds**.

Nodding Wild Onion is taller, the flower stem is bent, and it flowers in mid-summer.

**Did you know?** Unlike the domestic onion, the Prairie Onion has flat, solid (not hollow) leaves.
