[Prairie Onion](/plants/praonion/) has a distinctive onion smell and  is most commonly found in Canada's prairie provinces and the central United States. It grows in dry, sandy, or rocky grassland or desert areas.

Umbrella-shaped clusters of 15-30 small pink bell-shaped **flowers** (.25 in long) bloom from **May** to **July** at the top of a 4-10 in stalk. One or two narrow **leaves** appear before the flowers. Later in the season, you'll find capsules of 4-6 **seeds**.

[Nodding Onion](/plants/nodonion/) is taller, the flower stem is bent, and it flowers in mid-summer.

**Did you know?** Unlike the domestic onion, the [Prairie Onion](/plants/praonion/) has flat, solid (not hollow) leaves.
