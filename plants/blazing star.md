Blazing Star has a tall spike (6-12 in) of fluffy purple **flowers**. It flowers in late summer and can be found across Western Canada, Ontario, and the east/central United States.

Blazing Star (2-4 ft) grow in clumps in sunny areas. The grass-like **leaves** are largest at the base. Some varieties prefer dry, prairie conditions while others grow well in wet, marshy areas.

**Did you know?** The seed heads provide much-needed food for birds such as the **American Goldfinch**.
