Prairie Crocus flowers appear **as soon as the snow melts** in sunny, open areas and sandy hillsides from British Columbia to Ontario and south through the central United States. The upright, bluish-purple **flowers** are cup-shaped with 5-7 petal-like sepals (1.5 in across). The flowers appear before the leaves and very close to the ground.

The low-lying plants have gray-green **leaves** with many separate leaflets and are covered in woolly white hairs. The flowers turn into long, feathery clusters of **seeds**.

**Could it be?** **Canada Anemones** and **Cut-leaved Anemones** are similar in appearance but flower later in the year in early summer.

**Did you know?** Prairie Crocuses have many different names, including Windflower, Prairie Smoke, and Pasque Flower.
