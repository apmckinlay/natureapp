Red Paintbrush produces clusters of spiky, bright red or orange-yellow blooms at the tip of the stem. The **flowers** themselves are hard to spot; it's the bracts that are brightly colored.

There are many different varieties of Red Paintbrush that can be found throughout North America. Height varies from 6 in to 3 ft, depending on the species. The plant often forms a cluster of individual, erect **stems**. The **leaves** are long, narrow, and pointed.

Red Paintbrush can be found in prairies, open woodlands, and along the banks of streams throughout western North America. It flowers from **April** to **July**.

**Did you know?** Red Paintbrush has green leaves and produces its own food, but it also joins roots with neighboring plants to steal water and nutrients.
