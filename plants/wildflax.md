Wild Blue Flax have small, blue, saucer-shaped **flowers** (.75-1.5 in across) on a cluster of arching **stems** (1-2 ft) with long, narrow **leaves**. They flower from **May** to **July** with one flower appearing at a time on each stem, opening in the morning and closing by late afternoon.

Wild Blue Flax thrive in dry, sandy soil in sunny areas and can be found throughout Canada (except for the Maritimes) and the western two thirds of the United States (and Alaska).

Wild Blue Flax look very similar to cultivated flax; however, cultivated flax are an annual, not a perennial, and were imported from Eurasia.

**Did you know?** Indigenous peoples of North America used to use the tough fibrous stems for string, mats, snowshoes, fishing nets, and baskets.
