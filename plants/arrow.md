Arrowleaf Balsamroot are small, bushy plants (8-30 in tall) with long, arrow-shaped **leaves** (12-20 in long) and yellow sunflower-like **flowers** (2.5-4 in wide). They have a long taproot and a hairy **stem**. They’re common in cold, dry areas in western North America from British Columbia and Alberta south to California and Arizona and east to South Dakota.

Elk, Deer, and Bighorn Sheep graze on the plants, while small mammals and birds eat the seeds. Greater Sage-Grouse and Sharp-tailed Grouse nest under the Balsamroot’s branches. Native bees, such as Mason Bees and Miner Bees, are important pollinators.

**Could it be?** Arrowleaf Balsamroot flower in spring or early summer, while Prairie Sunflowers have smaller blossoms that appear in late summer. Arrowleaf Balsamroot have longer leaves.

**Did you know?** Almost every part of the plant can be eaten, from the seeds and leaves to the roots. First Nations people in British Columbia collected and ate large quantities of the roots.
