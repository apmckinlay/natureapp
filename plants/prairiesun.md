The Prairie Sunflower is one of many different sunflowers that are native to North America. It has large showy **flowers** (1½-3 in across) with 12-25 yellow ray petals surrounding a brown central disc. The central disc later forms a head of ¼ in brown **seeds** that are enjoyed by birds.

Prairie Sunflower is 1-3 ft high with many erect flower-bearing branches. It often grows in clumps and can be seen flowering along dry, sandy roadsides in **late summer**. It is common in most parts of the United States as well as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.

Prairie Sunflower is taller with larger flowers and more ray florets (petals) than Black-eyed Susan.

**Did you know?** Sunflower was a common crop of North American Indians as early as 3000 BC in modern-day Arizona and New Mexico. The plants provided dye, flour, and oil.
