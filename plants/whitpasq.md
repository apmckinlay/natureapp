White Pasqueflowers bloom soon after the snow melts in the sub-alpine meadows and slopes of the Pacific mountains. They are **low**, bushy plants (6-24 in high) with hairy **stems** and leaves. The light green, finely-divided **leaves** emerge from the base of the plants after the flowers.

The **flowers** are creamy-white (1-2 in wide) with a pale blue stain on the underside of the petals. The **seed heads** appear in mid- to late summer and are formed of long, white, feathery strands resembling a mop on a 20-in stem.

**Did you know?** White Pasqueflowers are known by many different names, including Old Man of the Mountain, Moptop, and Tow-headed Baby.
