The snow is still melting when **large clusters** of [Yellow Avalanche Lily](/plants/yelaval/) start to carpet mountain slopes and meadows in the foothills and mountains of northwestern Canada and the United States.

1-3 **flowers** dangle from a curving stalk (6-12 in high) with 2-3 large fleshy **leaves** (up to 14 in) at the base of the plant. The 6 yellow petals curve backwards exposing the stigma and anthers.

**Did you know?** The bulbs are a favorite food of [Grizzly Bear](/animals/grizzly/) and [Black Bear](/animals/blabear/), while [Elk](/animals/elk/) and Deer enjoy the leaves.
