Western Blue Flag can be found in **damp meadows** or **marshy** areas in the **mountainous** regions of British Columbia and Alberta as well as the northern and western United States.

The tall, slim **stems** (1-2 ft) bear 1-4 **flowers** with 9 petal-like segments, some of which curve downwards while others point straight up. They flower from **late May** to **early June** and their color varies from a very pale blue to a blue-violet. The long sword-shaped **leaves** (1-2 ft) are blue-green and grow from the base of the plant.

The rectangular **seed pod** (¾-2 in long) splits open on 3 sides when ripe, releasing dark brown seeds.

**Did you know?** Western Blue Flag is widespread in the western United States but has a very limited distribution in Canada, primarily along the southeastern edge of the Rocky Mountains. It is Alberta’s only native iris.
