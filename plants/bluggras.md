Blue Grama Grass is an important feature of central North America's **grasslands**. Their dense, shallow root mass holds the soil in place and prevents erosion. Look for their crescent-shaped **flowers** made up of little spikelets from **June** to **August**.

Blue Grama Grass grows in clumps (6-18 in tall) and are **grayish-green** in color. They can be found in prairie grasslands from British Columbia to Ontario and throughout much of the southern and western United States. They are often found alongside **Buffalograss**.

**Did you know?** Blue Grama Grass is also known as [Mosquito](/insects/mosquito/) Grass because the flowers resemble mosquito larvae.
