Wild Lupin has tall, showy spikes of pea-like **flowers** (20 in). The **leaves**, formed of 6-11 leaflets radiating from a central point, are usually found at the base of the plant and are covered with soft, silver hairs. A hairy **seed pod** (2 in long) turns black when mature.

Different species of Lupin are found in many parts of North America, particularly the northeast and the northwest. **Arctic Lupin** flowers are blue, purple, or pink. **Perennial Lupin** flowers are blue. **Bluebonnet** is a popular Texas wildflower.

Lupin grows well in moist or sandy soils in open areas and flowers from **May** to **June**. Look for it along roadways in British Columbia and Texas or in alpine meadows.

**Did you know?** Lupin derives its name from the Latin word for wolf because it was believed that the plant wolfed or robbed the soil of nutrients. In fact, Lupin improves the soil by adding nitrogen and organic matter.
