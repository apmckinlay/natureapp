Wild Lupines have tall, showy spikes of pea-like **flowers** (20 in). The **leaves**, formed of 6-11 leaflets radiating from a central point, are usually found at the base of the plants and are covered with soft, silver hairs. The hairy **seed pods** (2 in long) turn black when mature.

Different species of Lupines are found in many parts of North America, particularly the northeast and the northwest. **Arctic Lupin** flowers are blue, purple, or pink. **Perennial Lupine** flowers are blue. **Bluebonnets** are a popular Texas wildflower.

Lupines grow well in moist or sandy soils in open areas and flower from **May** to **June**. Look for them along roadways in British Columbia and Texas or in alpine meadows.

**Did you know?** Lupines derive their name from the Latin word for wolf because it was believed that the plants wolfed or robbed the soil of nutrients. In fact, Lupines improve the soil by adding nitrogen and organic matter.
