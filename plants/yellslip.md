If you are fortunate enough to spot a wild orchid, it will probably be the Yellow Lady's Slipper, which grows in most parts of Canada and the United States. The plant has 1 to 2 flowers on a long stalk (8-30 in) and flowers in **early summer**.

The **flower** is made up of a shiny yellow open pouch (or slipper) with 3 twisted greenish-brown petals above it. There are often reddish-brown spots or light stripes inside the pouch. The plant has 3-6 **leaves** (up to 7 in long) with deep parallel veins. The leaves resemble those of [Solomon's Seal](/plants/solomon) and [False Solomon's Seal](/plants/falsesol), and it may be hard to tell them apart if the plant isn't flowering.

Yellow Lady's Slipper often grows in **clumps** and can be found in moist, partially shaded meadows, forests, and bogs.

**Did you know?** Don't pick or try to transplant Yellow Lady's Slipper as it is relatively rare, slow growing, and has very specific soil and habitat requirements.
