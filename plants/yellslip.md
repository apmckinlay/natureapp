If you are fortunate enough to spot a wild orchid, it will probably be Yellow Lady's Slippers, which grow in most parts of Canada and the United States. The plants have 1 to 2 flowers on long stalks (8-30 in) and flower in **early summer**.

The **flowers** are made up of a shiny yellow open pouch (or slipper) with 3 twisted greenish-brown petals above it. There are often reddish-brown spots or light stripes inside the pouch. The plants have 3-6 **leaves** (up to 7 in long) with deep parallel veins. The leaves resemble those of [Solomon's Seals](/plants/solomon/) and [False Solomon's Seals](/plants/falsesol/), and it may be hard to tell them apart if the plants aren't flowering.

Yellow Lady's Slippers often grow in **clumps** and can be found in moist, partially shaded meadows, forests, and bogs.

**Did you know?** Don't pick or try to transplant Yellow Lady's Slippers as they are relatively rare, slow growing, and have very specific soil and habitat requirements.
