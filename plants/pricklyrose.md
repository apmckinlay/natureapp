In early summer, Prickly Wild Rose shrubs (8 in-4ft) across North America are covered with fragrant saucer-like **flowers**. The flowers have 5 petals and vary in color from pale pink to red. By late summer, the flowers will have become **rose hips**. The stems are usually covered in **prickles**. The dark green, serrated **leaflets** grow in groups of 3-9. 

The Common Wild Rose or Wood Rose is also native to North America, but it doesnâ€™t have prickly stems and is less common.

**Did you know?** Rose hips are high in Vitamin C and make excellent jelly.
