Blue Grama Grass is an important feature of central North Americaâ€™s **grasslands**. Its dense, shallow root mass holds the soil in place and prevents erosion. Look for its crescent-shaped **flower** made up of little spikelets from **June** to **August**.

Blue Grama Grass grows in clumps (6-18 in tall) and is **grayish-green** in color. It can be found in prairie grasslands from BC to ON and throughout much of the southern and western United States. It is often found alongside Buffalograss.

**Did you know?** Blue Grama Grass is also known as [Mosquito](/insects/mosquito) Grass because the flowers resemble mosquito larvae.
