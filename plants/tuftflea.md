Tufted Fleabane is a **short** plant (up to 12 in) with many hairy **stems** and white to light-purple **flowers**. It often forms large clumps and grows best in dry, grassy areas. It can be found in western Canada and the United States and flowers from **May** to **June**.

Numerous narrow petals surround a flat yellow center with 1-3 flowers per stem. Long, narrow leaves are clustered at the base of the plant.

[Philadelphia Fleabane](/plants/philflea) is similar but has a tall, single stem and clusters of small flowers. Fleabane blooms earlier than [Aster](/plants/aster) and has more petals. **Daisy** petals are notched.

**Did you know?** Tufted Fleabane's roots contain a turpentine-like oil that protects the plant from disease and grazing animals.
