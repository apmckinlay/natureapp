Ten different species of Fawn Lily can be found in North Americaâ€™s Pacific Northwest. Four of them can be found in British Columbia. The plants have large, fleshy **leaves**. 1-3 **flowers** dangle from curving stalks (6-12 in high). The petals curve backward to expose the stigma and anthers.

**Yellow** (E. grandiflorum) and **white** (E. montanum) glacier lilies are found  in mountain meadows at **higher elevations** and bloom shortly after the snow melts in the spring. They have green **leaves** with **no markings**.

**White** (E. oregonum) and **pink** (E. revolutum) fawn lilies appear at **lower altitudes** and have green **leaves** with **blotchy or striped markings**. The pink ones grow in moist woods or along streams, while the white ones grow in well-drained, open, grassy areas.

**Did you know?** The bulbs are a favorite food of [Grizzly Bears](/animals/grizzly/) and [Black Bears](/animals/blabear/), while [Elk](/animals/elk/) and Deer enjoy the leaves.
