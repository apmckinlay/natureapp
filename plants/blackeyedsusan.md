Black-eyed Susan has large (up to 3 in across) **flowers** with 10-20 **yellow** petals around a flat, dark brown centre. It has **hairy** leaves and stems (10-30 in). Native to the western plains, it has spread and is now common throughout North America. Youâ€™ll find it flowering all summer long in open, sunny locations.

Gaillardia is similar to Black-eyed Susan, but its petals are bicolored (yellow and pinkish-orange) around a reddish-brown central disc and each petal is notched and divided into 3 prongs. **Gloriosa Daisy**, a garden flower, is related to Black-eyed Susan but has larger orange, red, or bicolor flowers.

**Did you know?** Butterflies, bees, and other pollinators are attracted to the flowers and birds enjoy the seed heads in winter.
