Northern Bog Violets can be found across Canada and the United States at the edge of ponds or bogs, in wet ditches, along streams, or in moist, shady woodland areas. The large, deep violet **flowers** (.75 in across) are on long stems well above the leaves. The plants flower from **May** to **July** and are 5-10 in tall. There are clusters of heart-shaped **leaves** (up to 4 in wide) at the base of the plants.

The three-part seed capsules split open when ripe, spilling out masses of small **seeds**.

**Could it be?** [Early Blue Violets](/plants/earlyvio/) look very similar but are shorter, have smaller leaves, and grow in drier areas.

**Did you know?** The flowers of Northern Bog Violets are sometimes white.
