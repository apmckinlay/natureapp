Cow Parsnips are tall plants (3-10 ft) with flat umbrella-shaped clusters of small white **flowers** (4-8 in across). Stems are hairy and slightly ridged (2 in thick). The long, wide, woolly **leaves** (8-20 in) have jagged edges and are divided into 3 parts.

Cow Parsnips flower from **June** to **August**. They grow best in **moist**, **shady areas** but can also grow in open woodlands and clearings. They can be found from Labrador to Alaska and south to Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, and New Mexico. They are very common in **Alaska**.

Be careful not to brush up against Cow Parsnips as their sap increases skin sensitivity to the sun and can result in rashes and blisters.

**Could it be?** Cow Parsnips can be mistaken for Hemlocks, which are very poisonous. **Poison Hemlocks** have fern-like leaves. **Water Hemlocks** have small, oval leaflets with jagged edges. **Wild Parsnips** have a smooth stem with few hairs (1-2 in thick).

**Did you know?** The dry hollow stems can be used to make toy flutes and whistles.
