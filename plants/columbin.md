Different species of this showy woodland flower can be found across Canada, flowering  in shady woodlands and moist rocky sites from **late spring** to **early summer**. [Columbine](/plants/columbin/) is an erect, branching plant (1-3 ft) with groups of 3 green to blue-green **leaflets** with ragged edges.

The drooping bell-like **flowers** have 5 upward spurred petals (1-2 in) around a mass of bushy yellow stamens. The petals are often red or yellow but can also be blue. The spurs or tubes contain nectar that attracts long-tongued insects and hummingbirds. The flowers form individually or in groups of two or three.

**Garden [Columbine](/plants/columbin/)** comes in a wider range of colours, such as pink and blue, and is not native to North America.

**Did you know?** The spurred petals are said to resemble eagle talons, hence the [Columbine](/plants/columbin/)'s official name, Aquilegia, from the Latin word aquila meaning eagle.
