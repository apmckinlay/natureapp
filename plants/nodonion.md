Loose clusters (1.5-2 in across) of up to 40 small pinkish-white **flowers** nod their heads at the top of the long stalk (1-1.5 ft) of the Nodding Onion from **July** to **August**. Grass-like **leaves** (up to 22 in) emerge from the base of the plant. It can be found on rocky slopes, thinly-wooded bluffs, and open prairie from BC to SK and in most parts of the United States.

The flower stalks nod when in flower but become erect when **seeds** form.

Nodding Onion is less common than the Prairie Onion. It also flowers later in the season and is much taller. The **Pink-flowered Onion** flowers in the same season and some of the same areas, but its flower head is erect and doesnâ€™t nod. 

**Did you know?** Bees visit the nodding flower heads. Other insects are reluctant to hang upside down to reach the nectar. Facing downwards may protect the nectar from rain.
