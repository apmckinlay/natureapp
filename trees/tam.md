Tamarack is found across Canada and in the northeastern United States. Unlike most conifers, its **needles** turn golden and drop in the fall, growing new greenish-blue needles every spring. The needles are 5-7 in long and grow in clusters of 15-25.

Tamarack is a thin, medium-sized tree (50-65 ft) with reddish-brown **bark** that becomes scaly as the tree ages. It is often found alongside Black [Spruce](/trees/spruce/) in bogs or marshes or on cool, moist, north-facing slopes.

Both male and female **cones** may appear on the same branch. Male cones look like small mounds of yellow or brown pollen sacs. The female cones look like small pine cones. When mature, the female cones are brown, .4-.8 in long, on short curved stalks.

[Western Larch](/trees/westlar/) looks much like Tamarack but is only found in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest and is very tall.

**Did you know?** Tamarack can tolerate very cold temperatures and can be found at the edge of the tundra on the Arctic tree line.
