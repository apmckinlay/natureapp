American Lindens have fragrant pale yellow **flowers** with a long, narrow, light-green bract that appear in June. The small, round **fruit** hang in bunches from the bract. They mature in fall but may remain on the tree during the winter. The trees (60-80 ft) have heart-shaped **leaves** and are commonly planted along city streets across North America where they provide thick shade. They have a thick, straight **trunk** with dark bark that becomes furrowed as the tree matures. 

Lindens are native to North America and can be found in dry upland areas as well as moist, low woods.

**Did you know?** Linden flowers are very popular with bees. When a tree is in full bloom, there may be so many bees that you can hear their buzzing several feet away.
