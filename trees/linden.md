American Linden has fragrant pale yellow **flowers** with a long, narrow, light-green bract that appear in June. The tree (60-80 ft) has heart-shaped **leaves** and is commonly planted along city streets across North America.

Linden is native to North America and can be found on dry upland areas as well as moist, low woods.

**Did you know?** Linden flowers are very popular with bees. When a tree is in full bloom, there may be so many bees that you can hear their buzzing several feet away.
