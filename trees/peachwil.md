Peachleaf Willow is a **medium-sized** tree (35-40 ft), often growing in clumps, alongside streams and ponds in southern Canada from Quebec to British Columbia and south through most of the central and western United States. It usually has a single trunk. The **leaves** are long (2-5.5 in) and pointed, yellowish-green on top and whitish-green underneath. Male and female **catkins** dangle from the branches as leaves appear in early spring. Male flowers are longer and fall from the tree once they’ve released their pollen.

Rabbits, moose, deer, and elk eat the bark, leaves, and twigs. Beavers enjoy eating willow twigs, and the flowers are a source of nectar and pollen for bees.

Black Willow, found from New Brunswick to Manitoba and south to Florida and Texas, is very similar to Peachleaf Willow. Black Willow’s leaves are narrower and are not whitish-green underneath. Black Willow twigs snap easily while the Peachleaf Willow twigs are more flexible.

**Did you know?** Willow bark contains salicylic acid (Aspirin) and was used by First Nations as a remedy for headache, fever, or sore throat.
