Peachleaf Willow is a **medium-sized** tree (35-40 ft), often growing in clumps, alongside streams and ponds in southern Canada from Quebec to British Columbia and south through most of the central and western United States. It usually has a single trunk. The **leaves** are long (2-5.5 in) and pointed, yellowish-green on top and whitish-green underneath. Male and female **catkins** dangle from the branches as leaves appear in early spring. Male flowers are longer and fall from the tree once they've released their pollen.

Rabbits, [Moose](/animals/moose/), Deer ([Mule Deer](/animals/muledeer/), [White-tailed Deer](/animals/whtdeer/)), and [Elk](/animals/elk/) eat the bark, leaves, and twigs. [Beavers](/animals/beaver/) enjoy eating willow twigs, and the flowers are a source of nectar and pollen for bees.

[Black Willow](/trees/blackwil/), found from New Brunswick to Manitoba and south to Florida and Texas, is very similar to Peachleaf Willow. [Black Willow](/trees/blackwil/)'s leaves are narrower and are not whitish-green underneath. [Black Willow](/trees/blackwil/) twigs snap easily while the Peachleaf Willow twigs are more flexible.

**Did you know?** Willow bark contains salicylic acid (Aspirin) and was used by Indigenous peoples in North America as a remedy for headache, fever, or sore throat.
