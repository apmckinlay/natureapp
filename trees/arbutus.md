Arbutus has thin, smooth, reddish-brown **bark** that peels to reveal younger bark underneath. The crooked or leaning **trunks** split into numerous twisted branches with oval, leathery **leaves** that stay on the tree all year round. Leaves from the previous year turn reddish-orange and start to fall once the new leaves are fully grown. The tree can grow to a height of 100 ft.

Found along the **west coast** from British Columbia's Lower Mainland to Mexico, Arbutus grows best in **dry** regions with rocky or rapidly drained soils.

Clusters of small, bell-shaped white **flowers** droop from the end of stems in April/May. They smell strongly of honey, making them very attractive to bees. The **berries** are rough-skinned and reddish-orange and an important food for various birds and small mammals.

**Did you know?** Arbutus usually only grows within 5 miles of the ocean and is often found on exposed rocky bluffs.
