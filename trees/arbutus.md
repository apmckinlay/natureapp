Arbutus has thin, smooth, reddish-brown **bark** that peels to reveal younger bark underneath. The crooked or leaning **trunks** split into numerous twisted branches with oval, leathery **leaves** that stay on the tree all year round. The tree can grow to a height of 100 ft.

Found along the **west coast** from BCâ€™s Lower Mainland to Mexico, Arbutus grows best in **dry** regions with rocky or rapidly drained soils. 

Clusters of small, bell-shaped white **flowers** droop from the end of stems in April/May. They smell strongly of honey, making them very attractive to bees. The **berries** are rough-skinned and reddish-orange.

**Did you know?** Arbutus usually only grows within 8 km of the ocean and is often found on exposed rocky bluffs.
