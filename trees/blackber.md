Blackberry bushes are very common in the Pacific Northwest. Up to 9 ft tall, they form **dense**, **thorny thickets** in sunny areas beside roads and streams or in fields and waste areas. They grow best in regions with cool temperatures and lots of moisture.

**Pacific** or **Trailing Blackberry** are native to the Pacific Northwest with long, arching canes that send out roots once they touch the ground. They lose their leaves in the fall. Small white or light pink flowers appear in the spring or early summer. The fruit is initially red, turning black when ripe.

**Himalayan Blackberry**, also common in the Pacific Northwest, are an introduced species. They are more upright and maintains their leaves all year round.  **Allegheny Blackberry** are common in central and eastern North America and form an erect shrub.

**Is it a Blackberry or a Black Raspberry?** Raspberry fruit is hollow while Blackberries keep their core and have a white centre. The underside of Black Raspberry leaves is almost white, much lighter than the underside of Blackberry leaves.
