Western Larches have bunches of 15-30 light green, feathery **needles** (less than 2 in long) at the end of short spurs. The needles turn bright yellow before dropping in autumn. The trees are up to 150-200 ft tall and 4-7 ft in diameter. The first **branches** are often 50 ft up the tree. Western Larches are found in moist locations on northern mountain slopes and valley bottoms.

Western Larches have thick grooved **bark** with reddish-orange scales. The small, reddish-brown **cones** have long, slender bracts sticking out beyond the scales.

**Could it be?** [Tamaracks](/trees/tam/), also known as **Eastern Larches**, can be found across Canada and northeastern United States. They're not as tall as Western Larches.

**Did you know?** Western Larches are one of the most fire-resistant trees of the Pacific Northwest due to their thick bark (up to 6 in on an old-growth tree) and the height of their first branches.
