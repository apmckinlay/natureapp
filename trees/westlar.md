Western Larch has bunches of 15-30 light green, feathery **needles** (less than 2 in long) at the end of short spurs. The needles turn bright yellow before dropping in autumn. The tree is up to 150-200 ft tall and 4-7 ft in diameter. The first **branches** are often 50 ft up the tree. It is found in moist locations on northern mountain slopes and valley bottoms.

Western Larch has thick grooved **bark** with reddish-orange scales. The small, reddish-brown **cones** have long, slender bracts sticking out beyond the scales.

[Tamarack](/trees/tam/), also known as **Eastern Larch**, can be found across Canada and northeastern United States. It's not as tall as Western Larch.

**Did you know?** Western Larch is one of the most fire-resistant trees of the Pacific Northwest due to its thick bark (up to 6 in on an old-growth tree) and the height of its first branches.
