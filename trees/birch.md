Birch (20-70 ft) has triangular green **leaves** with serrated edges that turn yellow and then fall in autumn. The **bark** on mature trees is white and peels in paper-like strips. Male and female **catkins** form in the spring.

Birch is common in the temperate and boreal forests of Canada and the northern United States.

**Paper/White Birch** is native to North America, while **Silver Birch** grows in Europe. **Bog (Swamp) Birch**, a shrub (3-13 ft tall), and **Water Birch** (25-40 ft tall) grow around bogs and wet areas over many parts of North America.

**Did you know?** Birch trees can be tapped and their sap made into an edible syrup similar to maple syrup.
