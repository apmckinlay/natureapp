Birches (20-70 ft) have triangular green **leaves** with serrated edges that turn yellow and then fall in autumn. The **bark** on mature trees is white and peels in paper-like strips. Male and female **catkins** form in the spring.

Birches are common in the temperate and boreal forests of Canada and the northern United States.

**Paper/White Birches** are native to North America, while **Silver Birches** grow in Europe. Paper Birches thrive in moist soil at low to middle altitudes. They are one of the first trees to appear in burned areas. **Bog (Swamp) Birches**, a shrub (3-13 ft tall), and **Water Birches** (25-40 ft tall) grow around bogs and wet areas over many parts of North America. Unlike Paper Birches,  Water Birches' brown bark doesnâ€™t peel.

**Did you know?** Birch bark can be used as paper or to make baskets and canoes.
