Common Juniper is a **spreading shrub** with stiff green **needles** that circle the stem in groups of three. It often forms a low-lying mat but can grow to 3-4 ft tall. What appear to be blue **berries** are actually **cones** with very tightly packed miniature scales. 

Common Juniper grows well on **dry**, **rocky** sites. Itâ€™s extremely hardy and can be found world-wide, growing in a wide range of different habitats.

Rocky Mountain Juniper is a tree and has scale-like needles in overlapping pairs.

**Did you know?** Birds enjoy the fleshy covering on the cones and play an important role in propagating further plants as the seeds only germinate once the fleshy covering has dissolved.
