Common Juniper is a **spreading shrub** with stiff green **needles** that circle the stem in groups of three. It often forms a low-lying mat but can grow to 3-4 ft tall. What appear to be blue **berries** are actually **cones** with very tightly packed miniature scales.

Common Juniper grows well on **dry**, **rocky** sites. It's extremely hardy and can be found world-wide, growing in a wide range of different habitats.

[Rocky Mountain Juniper](/trees/rockyjun) is a tree and has scale-like needles in overlapping pairs.

**Did you know?** Birds enjoy the fleshy covering on the cones and play an important role in propagating further plants as the seeds only germinate once the fleshy covering has dissolved.
