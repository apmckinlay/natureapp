Common Junipers are **spreading shrubs** with stiff green **needles** that circle the stem in groups of three. They often form a low-lying mat but can grow to 3-4 ft tall. What appear to be blue **berries** are actually **cones** with very tightly packed miniature scales.

Common Junipers grow well on **dry**, **rocky** sites. They're extremely hardy and can be found world-wide, growing in a wide range of different habitats.

**Could it be?** [Rocky Mountain Junipers](/trees/rockyjun/) are trees and have scale-like needles in overlapping pairs.

**Did you know?** Birds enjoy the fleshy covering on the cones and play an important role in propagating further plants as the seeds only germinate once the fleshy covering has dissolved.
