American Elms are native to eastern and central Canada and the United States. They have also been planted along city streets over much of North America. Drooping clusters of hairy, reddish-green **flowers** appear in early spring, producing round, flat, papery **seeds**.

Elms have a **vase-shaped silhouette** with a single trunk spreading into a wide canopy of branches. They can grow up to 115 ft tall. The dark green, oval-shaped **leaves** have a pointed tip and serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. The **bark** is light to dark gray with deep, irregular grooves.

**Did you know?** Elms are threatened by Dutch elm disease. Notify your municipality if you spot a diseased tree.
