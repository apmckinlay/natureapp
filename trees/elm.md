American [Elm](/trees/elm/) is native to eastern and central Canada and the United States. It has also been planted along city streets over much of North America. Drooping clusters of hairy, reddish-green **flowers** appear in early spring, producing round, flat, papery **seeds**.

[Elm](/trees/elm/) has a **vase-shaped silhouette** with a single trunk spreading into a wide canopy of branches. It can grow up to 115 ft tall. The dark green, oval-shaped **leaves** have a pointed tip and serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. The **bark** is light to dark gray with deep, irregular grooves.

**Did you know?** [Elm](/trees/elm/) is threatened by Dutch elm disease. Notify your municipality if you spot a diseased tree.
