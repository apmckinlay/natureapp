Garry Oak grows in a narrow strip along the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, the Washington coast, the woodland valleys of Oregon, and the coastal foothills of California. It grows in open parkland or meadows alongside [Douglas-fir](/trees/doug) and a colorful display of spring flowers, such as [Camas](/plants/camas) and Shootingstar.

Garry Oak's **shape** varies from tall, straight trees (50-60 ft) to clumps of short, twisted, multi-stemmed trees. It has shiny green, deeply indented **leaves** and grayish-black **bark** with thick grooves or scales. The **acorns** are set in a shallow, scaly cup.

**Did you know?** Garry Oak is the only species of oak native to BC. It can be found in Pacific Rim National Park, Victoria, and Cowichan Garry Oak Preserve on Vancouver Island.
