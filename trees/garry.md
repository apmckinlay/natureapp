Garry Oaks grow in a narrow strip along the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, the Washington coast, the woodland valleys of Oregon, and the coastal foothills of California. They grow in open parkland or meadows alongside [Douglas-firs](/trees/dougfir/) and colorful displays of spring flowers, such as [Camas](/plants/camas/) and Shootingstars.

Garry Oaks' **shape** varies from tall, straight trees (50-60 ft) to clumps of short, twisted, multi-stemmed trees. They have shiny green, deeply indented **leaves** and grayish-black **bark** with thick grooves or scales. The **acorns** are set in a shallow, scaly cup.

**Did you know?** Garry Oaks are the only species of oak native to British Columbia. They can be found in Pacific Rim National Park, Victoria, and Cowichan Garry Oak Preserve on Vancouver Island.
