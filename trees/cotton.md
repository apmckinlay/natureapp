Cottonwood is a large, fast-growing tree (over 100 ft tall) that grows best in floodplains and beside lakes and rivers where there is plenty of water. Male and female **catkins** appear in early spring before the leaves. The tree releases so many fluffy white **seeds** in early summer that you may think it's snowing.

Cottonwood has triangular **leaves** with toothed edges that turn yellow in the fall. The **trunk** is broad and white.  The branches are weak and often break in a windstorm.

**Plains Cottonwood** grows in the west, while **Eastern Cottonwood** is found in the east.  **Black Cottonwood** is very similar to [Balsam Poplar](/trees/balpop/). They can be hard to tell apart as they hybridize. 

**Could it be?** [Balsam Poplar](/trees/balpop/) and [Aspen](/trees/aspen/) resemble Cottonwood as they are members of the same family. All of them release loose cottony seeds in late spring. Both Cottonwood and Trembling [Aspen](/trees/aspen/) have triangular or heart-shaped leaves, but Cottonwood is usually taller and its leaves are slightly serrated. [Balsam Poplar](/trees/balpop/) has oval or spear-shaped leaves.

**Did you know?** Cottonwood is the fastest-growing tree in North America, adding 3-6 ft to its height in a single year.
