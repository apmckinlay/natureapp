[Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/) is a large, fast-growing tree (up to 100 ft tall) that grows best in floodplains and beside lakes and rivers where there is plenty of water. Male and female **catkins** appear in early spring before the leaves. The tree releases so many fluffy white **seeds** in early summer that you may think it's snowing.

[Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/) has triangular **leaves** with toothed edges that turn yellow in the fall. The **trunk** is broad and white.  The branches are weak and often break in a windstorm.

**Plains [Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/)** grows in the west, while **Eastern [Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/)** is found in the east.  **Black [Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/)** is very similar to [Balsam Poplar](/trees/balpop/). They can be hard to tell apart as they hybridize; however, [Balsam Poplar](/trees/balpop/) normally has oval or spear-shaped leaves.

**Did you know?** [Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/) is the fastest-growing tree in North America, adding 3-6 ft to its height in a single year.
