Cottonwoods are large, fast-growing trees (over 100 ft tall) that grow best in floodplains and beside lakes and rivers where there is plenty of water. Male and female **catkins** appear in early spring before the leaves. The trees release so many fluffy white **seeds** in early summer that you may think it's snowing.

Cottonwoods have triangular **leaves** with toothed edges that turn yellow in the fall. The **trunk** is broad and white.  The branches are weak and often break in a windstorm.

**Plains Cottonwoods** grow in the west, while **Eastern Cottonwoods** are found in the east.  **Black Cottonwoods** are very similar to [Balsam Poplars](/trees/balpop/). They can be hard to tell apart as they hybridize. 

**Could it be?** [Balsam Poplars](/trees/balpop/) and [Aspens](/trees/aspen/) resemble Cottonwoods as they are members of the same family. All of them release loose cottony seeds in late spring. Both Cottonwoods and Trembling [Aspens](/trees/aspen/) have triangular or heart-shaped leaves, but Cottonwoods are usually taller and their leaves are slightly serrated. [Balsam Poplars](/trees/balpop/) have oval or spear-shaped leaves.

**Did you know?** Cottonwoods are the fastest-growing trees in North America, adding 3-6 ft to their height in a single year.
