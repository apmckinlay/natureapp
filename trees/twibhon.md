Twinberry Honeysuckle are upright, bushy **shrubs** (4-12 ft) that grow in moist, shady places throughout the western United States and Canada.

They have small, tubular yellow **flowers** that bloom in pairs from June to July. They develop into pairs of shiny black **berries** cupped by purple-red bracts.

The bright green oval-shaped **leaves** (.75-1.5 in wide) are hairy along the edges and underside.

**Did you know?** Indigenous peoples of North America used the berries to dye hair and other materials.
