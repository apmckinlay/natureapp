Engelmann Spruces are **high-altitude** trees native to the Coast and Rocky Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta south to Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. They're **straight** trees (80-195 ft tall) with a spire-like **crown**.

The four-sided bluish-green **needles** (1 in long) grow on all sides of the twigs. The light-brown **cones** (1.5-3 in long) hang down from the branches and have papery scales with a ragged outer edge. The reddish to purplish-brown **bark** is loose and scaly.

Engelmann Spruces continue to grow at a steady rate for 300 years, long after other trees have slowed down. Well-established trees are often 250-450 years old and trees have been known to reach 760-850 years.

**Did you know?** Sounding boards for violins, pianos, and guitars are often made with wood from Engelmann Spruces.
