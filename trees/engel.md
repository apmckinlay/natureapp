Engelmann [Spruce](/trees/spruce) is a **high-altitude** tree native to the Coast and Rocky Mountains of BC and AB south to Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. It's a **straight** tree (80-195 ft tall) with a spire-like **crown**.

The four-sided bluish-green **needles** (1 in long) grow on all sides of the twigs. The light-brown **cones** (1Â½- 3 in long) hang down from the branches and have papery scales with a ragged outer edge. The reddish to purplish-brown **bark** is loose and scaly.

**Did you know?** Sounding boards for violins, pianos, and guitars are often made with wood from Engelmann [Spruce](/trees/spruce).
