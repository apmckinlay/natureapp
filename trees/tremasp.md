Trembling Aspen is a slender tree (20-80 ft tall) with heart-shaped **leaves** that turn yellow in the fall. The leaf stem is flat and set at a 90-degree angle to the leaf, causing them to tremble in even a gentle breeze.

Trembling Aspen has greenish-white **bark** with dark ridges on older trees. It often grows alongside [Balsam Poplar](/trees/balpop) and [Birch](/trees/birch).

Trembling Aspen is widely distributed throughout North America. It is found at higher altitudes in more southern areas and doesn't grow in the Gulf Coast states. 

**Did you know?** Trembling Aspen's roots send up shoots or suckers to form large stands of up to 100 acres of identical trees or clones. Individual trunks die, but the roots can live on for hundreds or even thousands of years.
