Western Hemlock is a tall evergreen (90-200 ft) with a narrow crown. The new growth at the top of the tree often droops. Most of the **branches** swoop downwards. It’s common in the mild, humid climate of the Pacific Northwest and is often found growing below other trees as it’s shade-tolerant.

The **needles** are short, flat, and of unequal length with a soft, feathery appearance. They are yellowish-green on top and white below. The **bark** is red to dark brown, furrowed, and scaly. It has numerous small oval (½-1 in) **cones** hanging from the end of twigs.

**Mountain Hemlock** is less common and usually found at higher elevations. Its blue-green needles are all the same size and uniformly arranged around the twig; small clusters can appear star-like. Its cones are cylindrical and 2-3 times larger than those of Western Hemlock.

**Did you know?** Western Hemlock has a very shallow root system. It can be blown over in a wind storm and is easily damaged by fire.
