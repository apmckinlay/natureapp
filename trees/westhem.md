Western Hemlocks are tall evergreens (90-200 ft) with a narrow crown. The new growth at the top of the trees often droops. Most of the **branches** swoop downwards. The trees are common in the mild, humid climate of the Pacific Northwest and are often found growing below other trees as they're shade-tolerant.

The **needles** are short, flat, and of unequal length with a soft, feathery appearance. They are yellowish-green on top and white below. The **bark** is red to dark brown, furrowed, and scaly. It has numerous small oval (.5-1 in) **cones** hanging from the end of twigs.

**Mountain Hemlocks** are less common and are usually found at higher elevations. Their blue-green needles are all the same size and uniformly arranged around the twig; small clusters can appear star-like. Their cones are cylindrical and 2-3 times larger than those of Western Hemlocks.

**Did you know?** Western Hemlocks have very shallow root systems. They can be blown over in a wind storm and are easily damaged by fire.
