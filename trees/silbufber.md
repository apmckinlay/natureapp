Silver Buffaloberry (3-20 ft) is a thorny **shrub** with silvery-green **leaves**. The small yellow **flowers** bloom close to the stem and are inconspicuous. The shrub is often found growing along rivers and streams, especially on the northern Great Plains. It's slow to lose its leaves in autumn.

The clusters of red **berries** are sweeter and more edible (especially in jams or jellies) after the first frost.

[Wolf-willow](/trees/wolfwil) is similar in appearance but has silvery berries and no thorns. Sea Buckthorn has light orange berries and long, narrow green leaves.

**Did you know?** Silver Buffaloberry provides shelter and nesting sites for many birds. The berries are a favorite food of many songbirds and [Sharp-tailed Grouse](/birds/shtgrouse).
