Silver Buffaloberry (shepherdia argentea) are thorny **shrubs** (3-20 ft) with silvery-green **leaves**. The small yellow **flowers** bloom close to the stem and are inconspicuous. The clusters of red berries ripen in late summer. The shrubs are often found growing along rivers and streams, especially on the northern Great Plains. They're slow to lose their leaves in autumn.

**Could it be?** **Canada** or **Russet Buffaloberry** (shepherdia canadensis) look very similar to Silver Buffaloberry but have no thorns and less silvery hair on the leaves. [Wolf-willow](/trees/wolfwil/) are also similar in appearance but have silvery berries and no thorns. **Sea Buckthorn** have light orange berries and long, narrow green leaves.

**Did you know?** Silver Buffaloberry provide shelter and nesting sites for many birds. The berries are a favorite food of many songbirds and [Sharp-tailed Grouse](/birds/shtgrouse/).
