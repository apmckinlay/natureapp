Twinberry Honeysuckle is an upright, bushy **shrub** (4-12 ft) that grows in moist, shady places throughout the western United States and Canada. 

It has small tubular yellow **flowers** that bloom in pairs from June to July. They develop into pairs of shiny black **berries** cupped by purple-red bracts.

The bright green oval-shaped **leaves** (¾-1 ½ in wide) are hairy along the edges and underside.

**Did you know?** Native Americans used the berries to dye hair and other materials.
