Elderberry are 5-12 ft tall and wide with long **stems** arching out from the base. Large, flat-topped, umbrella-shaped clusters (10 in or more in diameter) of fragrant, white **flowers** appear from May to July followed in late summer or early fall by clusters of red or dark purple to black **berries**. The **leaves** are composed of 5-11 leaflets up to 12 in long.

Elderberry grow along streams and roadsides and in moist woodlands. They're often found in **large clumps** as they spread by root suckers. Elderberry can be found throughout  North America although they are less common in the prairie provinces, the Gulf states, and the North.

**Could it be?** Be careful. Many plants in the carrot family have umbrella-shaped flower clusters; some of them (e.g. **Water Hemlock**) are poisonous.

**Did you know?** Elderberry's Latin name - Sambucus - refers to a Greek musical instrument as the stems can be hollowed out to make flutes and whistles.
