Rocky Mountain Juniper grows in the mountainous areas of western North America. It is a **small** tree (3-6 ft) with reddish-brown to gray **bark** that shreds as it ages. The **trunk** is often knotty and crooked. It doesn't tolerate shade and is found alone or in small clusters, often on dry, exposed sites. It has scale-like, overlapping **needles**.

The small, berry-like **cones** are found at the end of branches. They're green when young, ripening to a dark blue with a whitish bloom.

[Common Juniper](/trees/comjun/) is a low-lying shrub with sharp, green needles in groups of three.

Rocky Mountain Juniper is also known as Rocky Mountain Redcedar. Its needles and bark are similar to those of [Western Redcedar](/trees/westred/); however, Rocky Mountain Juniper has blue berry-like fruit while [Western Redcedar](/trees/westred/) has small, egg-like cones.

**Did you know?** Rocky Mountain Juniper's berries are an important food source for Deer, [Mountain Goats](/animals/mountgoat/), and other animals. Many birds choose to nest in its branches.
