Rocky Mountain Junipers grow in the mountainous areas of western North America. They're **small** trees (3-6 ft) with reddish-brown to gray **bark** that shreds as it ages. The **trunk** is often knotty and crooked. They don't tolerate shade and are found alone or in small clusters, often on dry, exposed sites. They have scale-like, overlapping **needles**.

The small, berry-like **cones** are found at the end of branches. They're green when young, ripening to a dark blue with a whitish bloom.

[Common Junipers](/trees/comjun/) are low-lying shrubs with sharp, green needles in groups of three.

**Could it be?** Rocky Mountain Junipers are also known as Rocky Mountain Redcedars. Their needles and bark are similar to those of [Western Redcedars](/trees/westred/); however, Rocky Mountain Junipers have blue berry-like fruit while [Western Redcedars](/trees/westred/) have small, egg-like cones.

**Did you know?** Rocky Mountain Junipers' berries are an important food source for Deer, [Mountain Goats](/animals/mountgoat/), and other animals. Many birds choose to nest in their branches.
