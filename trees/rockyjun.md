Rocky Mountain Juniper grows in the mountainous areas of western North America. It is a **small** tree (3-6 ft) with reddish-brown to gray **bark** that shreds as it ages. The **trunk** is often knotty and crooked. It doesn’t tolerate shade and is found alone or in small clusters, often on dry, exposed sites. It has scale-like, overlapping **needles**.

The small, berry-like **cones** are found at the end of branches. They’re green when young, ripening to a dark blue with a whitish bloom.

Common Juniper is a low-lying shrub with sharp green needles in groups of three.

Rocky Mountain Juniper is also known as Rocky Mountain Redcedar. Its needles and bark are similar to those of Western Redcedar; however, Rocky Mountain Juniper has blue berry-like fruit while Western Redcedar has small, egg-like cones. 

**Did you know?** Rocky Mountain Juniper’s berries are an important food source for deer, mountain goats, and other animals. Many birds choose to nest in its branches.
