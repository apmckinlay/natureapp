Highbush Cranberry grows in moist areas of North Americaâ€™s boreal forest. A large **shrub** - 8-15 ft high and almost as wide - it has large (2-4 in long), 3-lobed **leaves** that resemble maple leaves but are more wrinkled. The leaves are glossy green in summer turning red in autumn.

The flat, umbrella-shaped clusters of white **flowers** can be seen from May to July. The clusters of red berry-like **fruit** ripen in late summer and have a musky odor.

There are several varieties of Highbush Cranberry across North America. Some are more edible when cooked than others.

**Did you know?** Highbush Cranberry belongs to the Honeysuckle family and is not actually a cranberry, unlike the true Lowbush Cranberry.
