Highbush Cranberry grow in moist areas of North America's boreal forest. A large **shrub** - 8-15 ft high and almost as wide - they have large (2-4 in long), 3-lobed **leaves** that resemble maple leaves but are more wrinkled. The leaves are glossy green in summer turning red in the fall.

The flat, umbrella-shaped clusters of white **flowers** can be seen from May to July. The clusters of red berry-like **fruit** ripen in late summer and have a musky odor. The fruit is an important food source for over-wintering birds as it is available all winter long.

**Did you know?** Highbush Cranberry belong to the Honeysuckle family ([Twinberry Honeysuckle](/trees/twibhon/), [Twining Honeysuckle](/trees/twinhon/)) and are not actually a cranberry, unlike the true Lowbush Cranberry.
