More than 100 species of Willow are native to North America. It has long, narrow **leaves** and thrives in moist soil. Male and female **catkins** dangle from the branches as leaves appear in early spring. Male flowers are longer and fall from the tree once they've released their pollen. Young **branches** are very flexible and can be used to make baskets, fences, or other objects.

Willows can range in size from low shrubs to tall trees. **Black Willow** is the largest native willow in North America (10-60 ft tall). It is often found along riverbanks and tolerates seasonal flooding. It's a fast-growing tree with several trunks growing out from the root and an open crown. **Peachleaf Willow** is a medium-sized tree (35-40 ft), often growing in clumps, alongside streams and ponds in southern Canada from Quebec to British Columbia and south through most of the central and western United States. It usually has a single trunk.

Rabbits, [Moose](/animals/moose/), Deer ([Mule Deer](/animals/muledeer/), [White-tailed Deer](/animals/whtdeer/)), and [Elk](/animals/elk/) eat the bark, leaves, and twigs. [Beavers](/animals/beaver/) enjoy eating willow twigs, and the flowers are a source of nectar and pollen for bees.

**Did you know?** Willow bark contains salicylic acid (Aspirin) and was used by Indigenous peoples in North America as a remedy for headache, fever, or sore throat.
