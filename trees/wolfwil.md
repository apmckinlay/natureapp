Wolf-willows are small **shrubs** (under 7 ft) with silver oval **leaves** and small yellow **flowers** with a distinctive musky-sweet scent when they flower in May/June. They grow in moister grassland areas, particularly on land that has been overgrazed, and are slow to lose their leaves in autumn.

**Could it be?** Wolf-willows aren't willows at all but belong to the **Oleaster** (wild olive) family and are related to [Silver Buffaloberry](/trees/silbufber/). [Silver Buffaloberry](/trees/silbufber/), however, have thorns and red berries.

**Did you know?** Indigenous peoples of North America used the large, yellow-striped seeds to make necklaces, and the fibrous bark can be twisted to make rope.
