[Wolf](/animals/wolf)-Willow is a small **shrub** (under 7 ft) with silver oval **leaves** and small yellow **flowers** with a distinctive musky-sweet scent when they flower in May/June. It grows in moister grassland areas, particularly on land that has been overgrazed, and is slow to lose its leaves in autumn. 

Wolf-willow isn't a willow at all but belongs to the oleaster (wild olive) family and is related to [Silver Buffaloberry](/trees/buffalo). [Silver Buffaloberry](/trees/buffalo), however, has thorns and red berries.

**Did you know?** First Nations people used the large, yellow-striped seeds to make necklaces and the fibrous bark can be twisted to make rope.
