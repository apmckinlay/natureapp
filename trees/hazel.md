[Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/) is a bushy **multi-stemmed shrub** up to 12 ft tall. The dangling light brown **catkins** appear well before the leaves and release yellow pollen in early spring. Small tassels of red **flowers** also appear in the spring. The broad oval **leaves** (2-7.5 in long) come to a point and have jagged edges. The small **nuts** are enclosed in green wrappings and can be hard to spot beneath the leaves. They are often in clusters.

Two varieties of [Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/) are native to North America. The **Beaked [Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/)** can be found across Canada and the northern United States as well as along the east and west coasts. The **American [Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/)** is found in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec as well as the eastern and central United States.

**Is it an American or a Beaked [Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/)?** The catkins on American [Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/) are attached to the stem by a short stalk. The catkins on Beaked [Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/) attach directly to the stem. The fruit of American [Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/) has a ruffled wrapping. The fruit of Beaked [Hazelnut](/trees/hazel/) is long, tubular, and beak-like (hence its name).
