There are various species of Spruce. They can be hard to tell apart, but they all share certain characteristics. This evergreen, 60-100 ft tall with a **cone-shaped silhouette**, prefers moist sites in forests and mountainous regions.

Four-sided **needles** are arranged in a spiral around the stem. The needles are attached to small pegs that remain behind after the needles drop. The **cones** hang downwards and fall to the ground.

**Black** and **White Spruce** are found in Canada and the northern United States. **[Engelmann Spruce](/trees/engel)** is found in the western mountains of Canada and the United States. **Sitka Spruce** has flat needles with a dip at the bottom and is found in a narrow band along the northwest coast of North America.

Spruce needles are shorter than **Pine** needles. **Fir** branches look flat as the needles grow out of two sides of the branch; Spruce needles grow on all sides of the branch.

**Did you know?** Young green tips, the tree's new spring growth, can be used to make tea.
