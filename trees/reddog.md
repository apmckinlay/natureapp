Red Osier Dogwood is a many-branched **shrub** about 6 ft tall. Its **red** stems and branches are particularly noticeable in winter. Clusters of small white **flowers** can be seen in **June**, and they develop into white, waxy **berries** enjoyed by many different birds. The pointed oval leaves are 1-3 in long.

Red Osier Dogwood grows throughout North America except for the southeastern United States. It grows well in damp areas (ditches, ravines, stream beds).

There are 30-60 species in the Dogwood family identified by their flowers, fruit, and bark. The [Pacific Dogwood](/trees/pacdog) is a common tree in British Columbia.

**Did you know?** Red Osier Dogwood can be used for basket weaving.
