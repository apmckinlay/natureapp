Oregon Grape has shiny green spiny **leaflets** that stay green all year round. Large clusters of small yellow **flowers** appear in the spring, turning to dark blue **berries** in late summer.

Oregon Grape can be found at low to middle elevations in mountainous areas in the Pacific Northwest from BC and eastern Alberta to northern California.

**Tall Oregon Grape** grows up to 8 ft tall in sunny areas. **Dwarf Oregon Grape** (1-3 ft tall) forms a ground cover in shady areas. **Creeping Oregon Grape** (12-18 in tall) has leaves that are more rounded.

**Did you know?** Oregon Grape berries are sour and contain large seeds but can be used to make jelly.
