Pacific Dogwoods are showy trees very common along the Pacific coast of southern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. Dogwoods are covered with large greenish-white **flowers** (not really flowers but bracts) from **April** to **June**. The 4 to 6 petal-like bracts (1-3 in long) appear before the leaves. The trees may bloom again in late summer.

Clusters of red **berries** appear in the autumn, and the leaves turn pinkish-red to yellowish-orange before falling.

Pacific Dogwoods are **medium-sized** trees (50-65 ft tall) and may look like a bush as they can have more than one main trunk. They have oval **leaves** with pointed tips (2-4 in long) in opposite pairs and smooth gray **bark**.

**Did you know?** Birds, [Beavers](/animals/beaver/), and Bears ([Black Bears](/animals/blabear/), [Grizzly Bears](/animals/grizzly/)) feast on the berries while deer nibble on the young twigs.
