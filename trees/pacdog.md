Pacific Dogwood is a showy tree very common along the Pacific coast of southern BC, Washington, Oregon, and California. The Dogwood is covered with large greenish-white **flowers** (not really flowers but bracts) from **April** to **June**. The 4-6 petal-like bracts (1-3 in long) appear before the leaves. The tree may bloom again in late summer.

Clusters of red **berries** appear in the autumn, and the leaves turn pinkish-red to yellowish-orange before falling.

Pacific Dogwood is a **medium-sized** tree (50-65 ft tall) and may look like a bush as it can have more than one main trunk. It has oval **leaves** with pointed tips (2-4 in long) in opposite pairs and smooth gray **bark**.

**Did you know?** Birds, [Beavers](/animals/beaver), and Bears ([Black Bear](/animals/blabear), [Grizzly Bear](/animals/grizzly)) feast on the berries while deer nibble on the young twigs.
