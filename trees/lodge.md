Lodgepole Pine is the most common and abundant tree in the Rocky Mountains and foothills of western North America. Found on lower mountain slopes, it has a thin, straight **trunk** (40-80 ft). If space is limited, **branches** will only appear on the top third of the tree.

The **needles** are paired and often twisted, forming dense clusters at the ends of branches. The **cones** are small and egg-shaped with prickles at the tip. They grow in small clusters, either at right angles to the branch or facing back towards the trunk

**Shore Pine** and Jack Pine also have bundles of two needles. **Shore Pine**, a variety of Lodgepole Pine, grows along the northern Pacific coast as a short, crooked tree. Jack Pine is widespread in northeastern North America, but the cones donâ€™t have prickles and point forward along the branch or curl around it.

**Did you know?** In the spring, look for clusters of reddish-green male pollen cones at the tips of branches. The pollen is so abundant it can be seen in patches on lakes or forming a yellow line marking the water level on rocks along the shore.
