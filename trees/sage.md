Sagebrushes are woody **shrubs** with hairy, silvery **leaves** that stay green all year round. They're normally 2-4 ft high but can be taller. They have a gray twisted **trunk** and branches with stringy, fragile **bark**. Small yellow **flowers** appear in late summer or early fall. They have a deep taproot that can gather water from far below the surface.

Sagebrushes are usually found in cold deserts with sandy or powdery soil and have a sharp odor (turpentine and camphor), especially after it rains.

**Did you know?** Sagebrushes provide food and habitat for many creatures, including Sage Grouse, Deer, [Elk](/animals/elk/), [Pronghorns](/animals/pronghorn/), [Bighorn Sheep](/animals/bighorn/), and Jack Rabbits.
