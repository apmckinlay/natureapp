Sagebrush is a woody **shrub** with hairy, silvery **leaves** that stay green all year round. It's normally 2-4 ft high but can be taller. It has a gray twisted **trunk** and branches with stringy, fragile **bark**. Small yellow **flowers** appear in late summer or early fall. It has a deep taproot that can gather water from far below the surface.

Sagebrush is usually found in cold deserts with sandy or powdery soil and has a sharp odor (turpentine and camphor), especially after it rains. 

**Did you know?** Sagebrush provides food and habitat for many creatures, including Sage Grouse, Deer, [Elk](/animals/elk), [Pronghorn](/animals/pronghorn), [Bighorn Sheep](/animals/bighorn), and Jack Rabbit.
