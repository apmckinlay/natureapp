Silver Buffaloberry (3-20 ft) is a thorny **shrub** with silvery-green **leaves**. The small yellow **flowers** bloom close to the stem and are inconspicuous. The shrub is often found growing along rivers and streams, especially on the northern Great Plains. Itâ€™s slow to lose its leaves in autumn.

The clusters of red **berries** are sweeter and more edible (especially in jams or jellies) after the first frost.
