Black Willow is the largest native willow in North America (10-60 ft tall). It prefers moist sites, such as riverbanks, and tolerates seasonal flooding. It's a fast-growing tree with several trunks growing out from the root and an open crown.

The **leaves** are long  (up to 5 in), narrow, green on both sides, and pointed at both ends. The dark gray-brown **bark** is deeply furrowed, while the **twigs** are light red and slender. Yellow-green **catkins** flower in March and April (later in northern areas).

Black Willow can be found from New Brunswick to Manitoba and south to Florida and Texas.

[Peachleaf Willow](/trees/peachwil), found from Quebec to British Columbia and south into the United States, is very similar to Black Willow. [Peachleaf Willow](/trees/peachwil)'s leaves are slightly wider and whitish-green underneath. Its twigs are fairly flexible, while Black Willow's twigs snap easily.

**Did you know?** More than 100 species of Willow are native to North America. The majority grow in moist soil and have flexible branches. Most are shrubs or dwarf trees.
