[Thimbleberry](/trees/thimble/) is a bushy **shrub** (1.5-5 ft tall) with large (4-11 in long and wide), 5-lobed **leaves**. Unlike Raspberry or Pacific [Blackberry](/trees/blackber/), it has no thorns.

Clusters of small, white **flowers** with 5 petals around a centre of pale yellow stamens can be seen between May and July. The red **berries** are small, flatter, and softer than raspberries. The fruit is edible but rather bland.

[Thimbleberry](/trees/thimble/) grows in forest margins and clearings of the western mountains as well as on the Pacific coast and around the Great Lakes.

**Did you know?** [Thimbleberry](/trees/thimble/) leaves look very similar to Maple leaves. However, pairs of Maple leaves appear opposite each other along the stem, whereas [Thimbleberry](/trees/thimble/) leaves alternate.
