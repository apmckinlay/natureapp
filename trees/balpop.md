Balsam Poplar is a **slender** tree with a straight trunk and a narrow crown (65-100 ft tall). Small **catkins** (3 in) on the male trees are the first to appear in the spring, followed by large, sticky, fragrant **leaf buds** that smell of balsam. Female trees release loose cottony **seeds** in late spring. The **leaves** are shiny and dark green with a pointed tip.

Balsam Poplar is a hardy tree growing in all parts of Canada, Alaska, and the central and northern United States. It's often found in **floodplains** as it grows best in moist, rich soil with plenty of sunlight.

[Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/) and [Trembling Aspen](/trees/tremasp/) look very similar and are members of the same family. [Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/) and [Trembling Aspen](/trees/tremasp/) have triangular or  heart-shaped leaves, whereas Balsam Poplar's leaves are oval or spear-shaped.

**Did you know?** Bees sometimes use Balsam Poplar's resin to disinfect their hives.
