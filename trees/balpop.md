Balsam Poplars are **slender** trees with a straight trunk and a narrow crown (65-100 ft tall). Small **catkins** (3 in) on the male trees are the first to appear in the spring, followed by large, sticky, fragrant **leaf buds** that smell of balsam. The **leaves** are shiny and dark green with a pointed tip.

Balsam Poplars are a hardy tree growing in all parts of Canada, Alaska, and the central and northern United States. They're often found in **floodplains** as they grow best in moist, rich soil with plenty of sunlight.

**Could it be?** [Cottonwoods](/trees/cotton/) and [Aspens](/trees/aspen/) resemble Balsam Poplars as they are members of the same family. All of them release loose cottony seeds in late spring. [Cottonwoods](/trees/cotton/) and Trembling [Aspens](/trees/aspen/) have triangular or  heart-shaped leaves, while Balsam Poplars' leaves are oval or spear-shaped.

**Did you know?** Bees sometimes use Balsam Poplars' resin to disinfect their hives.
