Bur Oaks can be found farther north than any other American oak. They have a straight trunk and are often as wide as they are tall. Bur Oaks grow in the open, away from dense forest. They can grow up to 100 ft tall; however, northern and eastern trees are shorter and shrubbier than those in southern regions.

The **leaves** are 6-12 in long with deep, irregular lobes. They turn yellow-green or yellow-brown in fall and may stay on the tree into the winter. The large **acorns** have cups with a fringed border and provide food for many mammals and birds including [White-tailed Deer](/animals/whtdeer/), [Squirrels](/animals/squirrel/), Ducks, and various species of Rodents.

**Did you know?** Bur Oaks can resist forest fires thanks to their very thick bark. They can also tolerate drought as they have very deep roots.
