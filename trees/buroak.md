Bur Oak can be found farther north than any other American oak. It has a straight trunk and is often as wide as it is tall. Bur Oak grows in the open, away from dense forest. It can grow up to 100 ft tall; however, northern and eastern trees are shorter and shrubbier than those in southern regions.

The **leaves** are 6-12 in long with deep, irregular lobes. They turn yellow-green or yellow-brown in fall  and may stay on the tree into the winter. The large **acorns** have cups with a fringed border and provide food for many mammals and birds including [White-tailed Deer](/animals/whtdeer/), [Squirrels](/animals/squirrel/), Ducks, and various species of Rodents.

**Did you know?** Bur Oak can resist forest fires thanks to its very thick bark. It can also tolerate drought as it has very deep roots.
