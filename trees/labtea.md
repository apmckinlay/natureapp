Labrador Tea is a low **evergreen** shrub with many erect branches and narrow leathery **leaves** turned under at the edges. The leaves have a pungent smell when crushed and a woolly mat of hair on the under surface. Labrador Tea can grow up to 3 ft tall but is often much shorter. 

Labrador Tea can be found in swamps, muskeg, and moist coniferous forests throughout Canada and in the northwestern and northeastern United States. It is a common feature of North Americaâ€™s boreal forests.

Clusters of small white **flowers** appear at the tips of branches from May to June.

Labrador Tea bears some similarities to Bog Rosemary, but Bog Rosemary leaves are very narrow with sharp points.

**Did you know?** Labrador Tea was a popular hot drink among North American Indigenous tribes.
