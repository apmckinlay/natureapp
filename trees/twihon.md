Twining Honeysuckle is a climbing **vine** (3-9 ft) with pairs of leaves. The pairs of **leaves** join and form a cup around the stem.

Clusters of yellow-orange trumpet-shaped **flowers** form between the pairs of leaves at the end of stems from May to July and deepen to purple before developing into clusters of round orange-red **berries**.

Twining Honeysuckle grows in woody or rocky areas.

**Did you know?** The trumpet-shaped flowers are popular with hummingbirds.
