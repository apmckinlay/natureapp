Manitoba Maple is native to Canada's prairie provinces but is now grown in most parts of Canada and the United States. Unlike most maples, the **leaves** consist of 3-9 small leaflets that turn yellow in the fall. 

The Manitoba Maple is often found along lakes and streams or in river floodplains. The tree is from 30-60 ft tall with a short, crooked **trunk**, several thick branches, and a spreading, uneven **crown**. The **bark** on mature trees has shallow ridges. 

The **flowers** appear as the leaves emerge forming small dangling clusters. In fall, you'll spot bunches of light brown, winged **seed pods** that spin in the air like helicopters when they fall.

Look for [Boxelder Bugs](/insects/boxelder) at the base of Manitoba Maples. The small newly-hatched red bugs are particularly noticeable. 

**Did you know?** Manitoba Maple seeds are an important food source for many small mammals and birds.
