Manitoba Maples are native to Canada's prairie provinces but are now grown in most parts of Canada and the United States. Unlike most maples, the **leaves** consist of 3-9 small leaflets that turn yellow in the fall.

Manitoba Maples are often found along lakes and streams or in river floodplains. The trees are from 30-60 ft tall with a short, crooked **trunk**, several thick branches, and a spreading, uneven **crown**. The **bark** on mature trees has shallow ridges.

Both a male, pollen-producing tree and a female, flower-producing tree are required for pollination. The **flowers** appear as the leaves emerge forming small dangling clusters. In fall, you'll spot bunches of light brown, winged **seed pods** that spin in the air like helicopters when they fall.

Look for [Boxelder Bugs](/insects/boxelder/) at the base of Manitoba Maples. The small newly-hatched red bugs are particularly noticeable.

**Did you know?** Manitoba Maple seeds are an important food source for many small mammals and birds.
