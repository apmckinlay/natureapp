Chokecherry flowers from May to June with elongated clusters of small white **flowers** that resemble a bottlebrush. The shiny red to black **berries** ripen in late August. 

Chokecherry is a shrub in northern areas and a small tree (3-26 ft) further south. It grows throughout Canada and the United States except in the northernmost areas and the Gulf states.

The **trunk** is sometimes twisted or crooked with smooth, grayish-brown **bark**. The **crown** is narrow and irregular. It has long reddish-brown **buds** in winter and broad oval **leaves** with finely toothed edges. 

Chokecherry leaves are widest above the middle of the leaf with a short pointed tip. **Pin Cherry** leaves are widest below the middle of the leaf and taper gradually to a point.

**Did you know?** Bears pull Chokecherry to the ground and tear its branches apart in their eagerness to eat the fruit. [Raccoons](/animals/raccoon), chipmunks, mice, and birds also love the fruit but cause less damage.
