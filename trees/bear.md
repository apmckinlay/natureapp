Bearberry is a **low-lying** shrub with long branches carpeting the ground. It has small (⅓-⅔ in long), leathery evergreen **leaves** and grows well in dry forests and exposed sandy areas with lots of sun in Canada, the northern United States, and the Rocky Mountains.

Drooping clusters of small, pinkish-white, urn-shaped **flowers** appear in May-June and are followed by bright red **berries** (less than ½ in in diameter) that remain on the branch year-round.

Bearberry is related to Manzanita trees and shrubs such as [Arbutus](/trees/arbutus).

**Did you know?** The berries provide food for bears and birds. North America's Indigenous people would dry and smoke the leaves.
