Bearberry are **low-lying** shrubs with long branches carpeting the ground. They have small (1/3 - 2/3 in long), leathery evergreen **leaves** and grow well in dry forests and exposed sandy areas with lots of sun in Canada, the northern United States, and the Rocky Mountains.

Drooping clusters of small, pinkish-white, urn-shaped **flowers** appear in May-June and are followed by bright red **berries** (less than Â½ in in diameter) that remain on the branch year-round.

Bearberry are related to **Manzanita** trees and shrubs such as [Arbutus](/trees/arbutus/).

**Did you know?** The berries provide food for bears and birds. Indigenous peoples in North America used to dry and smoke the leaves.
