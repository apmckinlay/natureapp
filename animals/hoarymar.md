Hoary Marmot live in the **mountains** at or above the **treeline**. They are large, bulky ground squirrels (18-22 in long, up to 16 lbs) with a thick fur coat that is **white** over the **upper back** and **shoulders**.

Hoary Marmots live in **colonies** with a dominant male, several breeding females, young, and sometimes a few subordinate males. They build a **burrow**, often under a boulder, with several chambers and tunnels and multiple entrances. They are active during the day and eat grass and plants. In most areas, they hibernate from September to April.

Hoary Marmot are larger than __Yellow-bellied Marmot__ and live at higher altitudes. [Pika](/{{section}}/pika) also live in the mountains above the treeline, but they are much smaller than Hoary Marmot.

**Did you know?** Hoary Marmots are also known as Whistlers and Whistle Pigs because of the high-pitched sound they make to warn other marmots in their colony of predators.
