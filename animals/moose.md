Moose are the largest (5-6.5 ft at shoulders) members of the deer family and the **largest mammal** in North America. They can be found in the **forests** and **wetlands** of northern Canada, Alaska, around the Great Lakes, and in the northwestern mountains. Their **huge shoulder muscles** look like a hump, a **flap of skin** dangles from their **throat**, and the males have huge **flattened antlers** that are shed every year. Wide hooves act like snowshoes, making it easier for them to walk on snow.

Moose eat many different kinds of plants, fruit, and bark. They are so tall that they prefer to browse on higher plants as it can be difficult to bend their head to ground level. They are often seen in **lakes** or **wetlands** feeding on aquatic plants. They have poor eyesight but a strong sense of smell.

Moose are larger, darker-colored, and more solitary than [Elk](/{{section}}/elk). Confusingly, European&nbsp;[Elk](/{{section}}/elk) are related to North American Moose, whereas European Red Deer are closely related to North American [Elk](/{{section}}/elk).

**Did you know?** Moose are powerful swimmers and can even dive for food. The young swim well within a few days of being born.
