Mink live in forested areas near streams, rivers, marshes, or lakes. They have **long, narrow bodies** and a **long, bushy tail** (total length of 26-30 in). Their thick, **chocolate-brown fur** with a **white chest** or **chin patch** is water resistant. They have short legs and very small ears. They can be found in Canada and in the east and central areas of the United States.

Mink spend a lot of their time in **water** and are very good **swimmers**. They can dive to depths of up to 16 ft. They're also very good at **climbing** trees and at **jumping** from tree to tree. They eat small animals, preferably [Muskrat](/animals/muskrat/), as well as birds, frogs, and fish. They are most active at dusk and dawn.

Mink use scent to mark their territory and **live alone** except when mating. They often make their home in abandoned burrows or muskrat dens.

[Weasel](/animals/weasel/) are smaller than Mink. [Marten](/animals/marten/) spend much of their time in trees in northern evergreen forests.

**Did you know?** Mink often kill more prey than they can eat, storing the surplus for later.
