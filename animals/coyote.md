Coyote are the **size** of a medium-sized dog (3-5 ft long) with gray to reddish **fur**, a white belly, a bushy black-tipped **tail**, and a **thin face** with **pointed ears**. They eat almost anything (fruit, insects, fish) and have adapted to a wide range of habitats right across North America, including towns and cities. They use their keen sense of smell to find food and avoid predators.

Males and females may mate for life. The female enlarges a rodent or rabbit hole to make a den and has a litter of up to 19 young. Both parents feed the young until they are 2 months old.

Coyote are very vocal with a wide range of calls to greet and communicate with each other or warn of danger.

[Wolf](/animals/wolf/) are larger than Coyote with a broader face, larger nose, smaller ears, and a lower voice. [Red Fox](/animals/redfox/) are smaller.

**Did you know?** Coyote are very good swimmers.
