[Weasel](/animals/weasel/) are small, **thin**, **long-bodied** animals with **short legs**, a small head, and a long tail. They are extremely flexible and can squeeze through tiny holes and along narrow passages. [Weasels](/animals/weasel/) vary in length from 5-12 in with a reddish-brown back and a white belly. They turn white in **winter** in northern regions. Many but not all North American weasels have a black tip to their tail.

[Weasels](/animals/weasel/) are solitary animals and can be found in tundra, grasslands, and forests in northern North America as well as in Europe and Asia. **Short-tailed [Weasel](/animals/weasel/)** are one of the most common and can be found on all 3 continents. **Long-tailed [Weasel](/animals/weasel/)** are one of the largest and are found in North America, along with **Least [Weasel](/animals/weasel/)** and **Ermine**. It can be hard to tell them apart.

[Weasels](/animals/weasel/) are ferocious hunters and can kill animals much larger than themselves although they most commonly hunt mice and voles. [Weasels](/animals/weasel/) are active at **night** but can also be seen during the day.

[Weasels](/animals/weasel/) mate in the summer, but the fertilized embryos will remain dormant until 3-4 weeks before their birth the following spring or summer. The young stay with their mother until they learn to hunt for themselves.

[Weasel](/animals/weasel/) are related to [Mink](/animals/mink/), [Marten](/animals/marten/), and **Black-tailed Ferret**.

**Did you know?** [Weasels](/animals/weasel/) are unable to store energy as fat so they need a constant supply of food. They eat 40-60% of their body weight in food every day.
