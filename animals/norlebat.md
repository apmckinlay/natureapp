[Northern Long-eared Bats](/animals/norlebat/) have brown fur (darker on their back than on their underside), **long pointy ears** and are 3-4 in long with a 9-10 in wingspan. They live in **forests** across Canada and in the eastern United States.

[Northern Long-eared Bats](/animals/norlebat/) roost under tree bark or in tree cavities and tend to be **solitary**. They fly through the forest understory hunting for moths, flies, and other insects. They are cold-tolerant, hibernating in narrow crevices near the mouth of caves or mines.

**Did you know?** The number of [Northern Long-eared Bats](/animals/norlebat/) has declined dramatically as they have been badly affected by white-nose syndrome.
