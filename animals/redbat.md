Red Bats are medium-sized bats (12 in wingspan) with a **reddish-orange** coat. The males are usually redder than the females who have white tips on their fur. Red Bats are solitary and roost well hidden in the thick foliage of **forest** trees. They often hunt for food around lights and particularly enjoy moths and beetles.

Eastern and Western Red Bats look very similar and are hard to tell apart. **Eastern Red Bats** can be found east of the Rocky Mountains across the southern Canada to the Atlantic coast and south to central Florida, west Texas, and southern New Mexico. **Western Red Bats** are found along the west coast in the southwestern United States. They migrate south to warmer parts of their range in winter.

**Did you know?** Red Bats hibernate in hollow trees or under leaf litter, using their thickly-furred tail as a blanket to keep them warm.
