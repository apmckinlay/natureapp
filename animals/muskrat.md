Muskrats can be found **swimming** in marshes, ponds, lakes, and rivers throughout North America. A large rodent (12 in body) with waterproof brown fur and a **narrow, pointed, leathery tail** (8-11 in), they live in large family groups, sheltering in bank burrows or constructed nests.

Muskrats have large, hairy hind feet that act like paddles when swimming. They eat plants; [Cattails](/plants/cattail/) are a favorite. By harvesting marsh plants, they create open water for birds and other wildlife.

Muskrats are most active at dusk and at night. A favorite location is **marshes** with a constant water level and lots of vegetation for eating and nest construction.

**Could it be?** Muskrats are smaller than [Beavers](/animals/beaver/) with a much thinner tail.

**Did you know?** Muskrats are excellent swimmers, moving as fast as 3 miles per hour. They can even swim backwards and can stay underwater for up to 20 minutes.
