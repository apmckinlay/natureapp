Harbor Seal are found north of the equator in both the **Atlantic** and **Pacific oceans**. A small group of seals lives in the freshwater rivers and lakes of Quebec's northern Ungava peninsula. Harbor Seal gather in **harbors** and estuaries to hunt for fish and can often be seen lying alone or in small groups on rocky shores or islands.

Harbor Seal are 4.5-6 ft long with **spotted coats** in a variety of colors and weigh up to 300 lbs. They have a small rounded head and whiskery muzzle. Their short front flippers have claws for grooming and defence. They swim by moving their wide fan-like hind flippers from side to side.

Harbor Seal mate from spring to early summer when they're 3-7 years old. The females give birth to one pup (on land or in water) 9-11 months after mating.

Male **Northern Elephant Seal**, true to their name, have a large nose. They are 10-13 ft long and weigh 1,500-4,500 lbs (females are much smaller than males). They come close to land in December to breed on offshore islands or on remote coastal beaches from Baja California to Alaska.

**Could it be?** [Sea Lion](/animals/sealion/) are larger and have longer flippers than Harbor Seal. [Sea Lion](/animals/sealion/) have ear flaps while Harbor Seal don't. They can support themselves on their flippers and walk, while Seal inch forward on their belly. [River Otter](/animals/rivotter/) are sometimes found in coastal areas. They have long, slim bodies and tails and are as adept on land as in the water.

**Did you know?** Harbor Seal can swim right-side up or upside down at speeds of up to 12 mph. They can dive to depths of 300 ft and stay underwater for up to 30 minutes.
