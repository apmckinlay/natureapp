Little Brown Bats have light brown **fur**, weigh less than half an ounce, and have a wingspan of 8-11 in. They are abundant across North America although they're present in lesser numbers in the southern states. They have an average lifespan of 6-7 years but can live much longer.

Little Brown Bats live in large **colonies**, leaving their roost at dusk and dawn to hunt for insects and spiders. Their high-pitched calls bounce off objects, helping them to find their prey. Summer roosts are tree cavities and buildings (often used by maternity colonies). They **hibernate** over the winter in caves or abandoned mines.

The females give birth to one offspring annually with the pups ready to fly and find their own food at 3 weeks.

Little Brown Bats fly and forage close to the surface of water and eat a great many aquatic insects such as **Caddisflies**, [Mosquitoes](/insects/mosquito/), and [Mayflies](/insects/mayfly/).

**Did you know?** Little Brown Bats can eat up to 1,000 small flying insects in under an hour.
