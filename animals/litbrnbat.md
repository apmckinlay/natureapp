Little Brown Bats have light brown **fur**, weigh less than half an ounce and have a wingspan of 8-11 in. They are abundant across North America although they're present in lesser numbers in the southern states.

Little Brown Bats live in large **colonies**, leaving their roost at dusk and dawn to hunt for insects. Summer roosts are tree cavities and buildings (often used by maternity colonies). They **hibernate** over the winter in caves or abandoned mines.

Little Brown Bats fly and forage close to the surface of water and eat a great many aquatic insects such as Caddisfly and Mayfly. 

**Did you know?** Little Brown Bats can eat up to 1,000 small flying insects in under an hour.
