Pronghorns are reddish-brown, **deer-like** creatures with white stomachs,  2 white stripes across their  throats, and branching horns. They can be found year-round on the North American **plains** from southern Saskatchewan to northern Mexico. They're approximately 3 ft tall. Females weigh less than males. Large eyes located near the back of their head provide excellent vision. They can spot predators from up to 3 miles away.

Pronghorns travel in small groups and eat grasses and shrubs. They signal danger by raising the fur of the large white patch on their rump. Although they resemble and are often referred to as Antelopes, they belong to a different family. Their closest living relatives are Giraffes and Okapis.

**Did you know?** Pronghorns are the second-fastest animal in the world with amazing endurance thanks to long legs and a large heart and lungs. They can sprint up to 70 mph.
