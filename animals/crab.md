[Crabs](/animals/crab/) are usually found in the rock pools and coral reefs of shallow **ocean** waters, but some can be found in deep water, while others live on land or in freshwater. Two of the most common varieties are **Green** and **Purple Shore [Crab](/animals/crab/)**.

[Crabs](/animals/crab/) have a **flat body** with a thick **shell**, 2 feeler antennae, and 2 eyes on stalks. They have 5 pairs of **legs**, including 2 claws, and **move sideways**. Most only reach a few inches across, but a few are much larger. [Crabs](/animals/crab/) have no backbone. Their hard shell supports them and protects them from predators. They eat plants and animals but feed mainly on algae.

Fertilized eggs are glued onto the female's abdomen and released as newly-hatched larvae. The juveniles moult several times as they grow and become adults.

**Horseshoe [Crab](/animals/crab/)** are not a true [Crab](/animals/crab/); instead, they are closely related to Spiders and Scorpions. **Porcelain [Crab](/animals/crab/)** look a lot like a [Crab](/animals/crab/), but they only have 4 pairs of legs. They will shed a leg to escape from a predator.

**Did you know?** [Crabs](/animals/crab/) communicate with each other by drumming or waving their pincers.
