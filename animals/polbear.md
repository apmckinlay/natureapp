Polar Bears are found off the coasts of Alaska and northern Canada as far south as James Bay. They are 8 ft long and weigh 900-1600 lbs. They are related to Brown Bears but have adapted to live in a cold climate with long white **fur** and a layer of fat to keep them warm.

Polar Bears spend most of their lives on sea ice where they spend up to 50 percent of their time hunting for food, usually Seals. Cubs are born between late November and early January in a den hollowed out of a snowbank by the mother.

**Did you know?** Polar Bears are excellent swimmers, paddling with their front paws and using their straight hind legs as a rudder. They can swim at speeds of up to 6 miles per hour.
