Polar Bear are found off the coasts of Alaska and northern Canada as far south as James Bay. They are 8 ft long and weigh 900-1600 lbs. Their **long white fur** and a layer of fat keep them warm.

Cubs are born between late November and early January. The bears' main source of food is __Seal__.

**Did you know?** Polar Bear spend almost their entire lives on sea ice. This is where they hunt, mate, and raise their young.
