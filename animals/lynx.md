Lynx are **solitary**, seldom-seen cats found in **northern boreal forests**, primarily in Canada, but there are a few in forests and mountainous areas near the US/Canadian border. Lynx are 2 ft tall and 3 ft long with **tufts of black hair **on the** tips **of their** ears**, a short **tail** with a black tip, and tufts of **beard-like fur** on the sides of their face. They have long legs and a very **wide face**.

Lynx's **large furry paws** act like snowshoes, making it easier for them to move around in deep snow. Lynx feed almost exclusively on __Snowshoe Hare__, although they will eat other small animals if there aren't many Hare. They are very territorial, refusing to share their territory with other Lynx and only come together to mate.

[Bobcat](/{{section}}/bobcat) are similar in appearance but have smaller feet, shorter legs, spotted fur, and smaller tufts on their ears. [Bobcat](/{{section}}/bobcat) have black stripes around their tail and the tip is black on top but white underneath. They are also more common further south. [Cougar](/{{section}}/cougar) are twice as long as Lynx.

**Did you know?** Lynx hunt at night and are so well adapted to the darkness that they can spot prey from 250 feet away.
