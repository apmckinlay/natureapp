13-lined Ground Squirrel are small (8-12 in head to tail) brown rodents with 13 brown and white **stripes** down their back and a black-striped **tail**.  They are found in the open **grasslands** of south-central Canada and the central United States. They avoid wooded areas but have adapted well to **urban** areas (parks, cemeteries, roadsides).

13-lined Ground Squirrel  build networks of underground **tunnels** with multiple chambers where they hibernate over the winter. They eat seeds, nuts, roots, and insects. They have one litter of 6-7 young a year, usually at the end of May.

13-lined Ground Squirrel are most active in **daytime** and can be spotted standing up on their haunches to view their surroundings. They use alarm calls to notify each other of danger.

**Could it be?** 13-lined Ground Squirrel resemble __Chipmunk__, but Chipmunk have stripes on their head and body, longer faces, and internal cheek pouches they can stuff with seeds. [Richardson's Ground Squirrel](/animals/richgs/) (gophers) are larger and don't have stripes.

**Did you know?** In addition to the long, deep burrows they use for nesting and hibernation, 13-lined Ground Squirrel also dig short, dead-end tunnels where they can escape in an emergency.
