White-tailed Deer are the **smallest** North American deer and are found throughout the **United States** (except for the southwest desert regions) and **southern Canada**. They spend their **summers** in fields grazing on plants, grasses, and twigs and their **winters** in forested areas where less snow cover makes it easier for them to find food and shelter.

White-tailed Deer have reddish-brown fur in **summer** and grayish-brown fur in **winter**. They have **white** fur around their eyes and nose, on their throat and stomach. Their foot-long **tail** is held erect when they run displaying its white underside. The males’ **antlers** have numerous points projecting upwards from the main forward-curving branch.

[Mule Deer](/animals/muledeer) are taller and heavier than White-tailed Deer. They have very large ears, a white patch around their tail, and a black forehead, light gray face, and white throat. [Mule Deer](/animals/muledeer) jump high in the air when frightened and don’t flash their tails. White-tailed Deer raise their tail, displaying its white underside, to signal danger. [Mule Deer](/animals/muledeer) have a stiff-legged bounding gait, while White-tailed Deer have a smooth, flowing gait.

**Did you know?** White-tailed Deer use scent from several external glands to communicate with other animals. Every step is marked by a smelly substance from glands between their toes.
