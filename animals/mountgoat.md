Mountain Goat live on **steep, rocky cliffs** and **ledges** high in the mountains from Alaska and Yukon through British Columbia and Alberta to Washington, Idaho, and Montana. They can sometimes be seen beside highways in mountain regions.

Mountain Goat are 3-3.5 ft tall with long, thick coats of **creamy white fur**. They have a **long, narrow face** with **beard-like hair** on their chin, and a short tail. Their horns are shiny-black, slender, and point backwards.

They eat grasses, herbs, lichen, and twigs.

Mountain Goat can jump up to 12 ft in a single leap. The females and males spend most of the year in herds. The males are more solitary. The goats mate from November to December and the young are born in late May/early June.

[Bighorn Sheep](/animals/bighorn) have large curving horns and gray-brown fur.

**Did you know?** In winter, Mountain Goat move to south/southwest-facing slopes and windswept ridges where it will be easier to find food.
