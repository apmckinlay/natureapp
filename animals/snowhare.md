Snowshoe Hare are found in the **forests** of Canada, Alaska, and the northern mountainous areas of the United States. They are smaller than other Hares (14-20 in long) and have **smaller ears**. They turn white in winter, except for the tip of their ears that remain black. Their **large furry feet** help them to walk on snow.

Snowshoe Hare prefer forested areas with dense undergrowth where they can hide and shelter. They feed at night, following well-used trails to nibble on plants, grasses, and leaves as well as twigs and bark in winter. Hares move very quickly and have several litters each year.

Snowshoe Hare are larger than **Rabbits** and typically have taller hind legs and longer ears. Baby Rabbits are furless and their eyes are closed when they’re born.

**Did you know?** Snowshoe Hare are usually silent, but they snort when they’re annoyed. Males and females make a clicking sound with each other during breeding season and the does use this sound with their young.
