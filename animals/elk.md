[Elk](/animals/elk/) are related to Deer but much **larger** (4 ft tall, 6-9 ft head to tail) than most of their relatives. They have a **dark shaggy mane** from neck to chest, a light-colored rump patch, large **antlers**, and long **legs**. An [Elk](/animals/elk/)'s winter coat is 5 times warmer than its summer coat with an outer layer of long guard hairs and a dense woolly undercoat.

[Elk](/animals/elk/) can be found in western North America, especially the **mountainous regions**. They eat grass, plants, leaves, and bark, browsing in large open meadows at dusk and dawn and sheltering in the nearby forest to chew their cud during the day.

[Elk](/animals/elk/) are social animals, spending most of the year in single-sex groups. In mountainous areas, they spend winters in valleys moving to higher, cooler elevations in summer.

Male [Elk](/animals/elk/) **bellow loudly** during mating season and use their antlers to fight other males in order to dominate the herd and attract females. Older, more successful males will then protect a small herd of approximately 6 females and their young.

Deer are smaller than [Elk](/animals/elk/). [Moose](/animals/moose/) are larger, darker-colored, and solitary. Confusingly, European Red Deer are closely related to North American [Elk](/animals/elk/), whereas European [Elk](/animals/elk/) are related to North American [Moose](/animals/moose/).

**Did you know?** Male [Elk](/animals/elk/) shed their antlers in March and start growing new ones in May. The antlers grow very quickly - up to 1 inch a day in summer - and may be 4 ft long by summer's end.
