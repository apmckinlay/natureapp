Wolverine resemble a small bear, but they're actually related to [Mink](/animals/mink/), [Weasel](/animals/weasel/), [Badger](/animals/badger/), [River Otter](/animals/rivotter/), and [Sea Otter](/animals/seaotter/). They have a **large head** and **stocky body** (26-34 in), short legs, large paws, and a **bushy tail** (7-10 in). They have **dark brown fur** with **pale golden-brown stripes** along the side of their body and pale fur around their eyes and snout.

Wolverine are solitary animals that roam large distances in search of food. They can be found in northern Canada and the Arctic as well as above the treeline in the Rocky Mountains.

Wolverine have very strong teeth and jaws and can bite through fresh and frozen meat and bones.

**Did you know?** Wolverine have strong family ties. The young kits stay with their mother for up to 2 years and the fathers interact with their young even when they're full grown.
