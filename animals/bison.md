[Bison](/animals/bison/) are North America's largest mammal. They are 7-11.5 ft long with a **large head**, small curving **horns**, and a **hump** between their massive shoulders. Their brown **fur** is especially thick around the head and shoulders. They shed their long, shaggy winter coat in spring; their summer coat is lighter in weight and in color.

Isolated herds of [Bison](/animals/bison/) can be found in various North American parks. There are two varieties. **Wood [Bison](/animals/bison/)** are larger and heavier with a darker coat and a straggly beard. **Plains [Bison](/animals/bison/)** are smaller with lighter hair, a woolly cap between the horns, a thick beard, and a mane around the throat.

[Bison](/animals/bison/) live and travel in **groups** with males in one group and females and calves in another. The males temporarily join the females during the summer breeding season. Calves are born the following spring.

[Bison](/animals/bison/) run at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour and are good swimmers. They eat grasses, sedges, shrubs, and twigs.

**Did you know?** [Bison](/animals/bison/) are sometimes referred to as "buffalo", but technically **Buffalo** refers to Asian (Water Buffalo) and African (Cape Buffalo) that have smaller heads, larger horns, and don't have a hump between their shoulders or a beard.
