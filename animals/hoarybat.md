[Hoary Bats](/animals/hoarybat/) have white-tipped brown **fur** on back and tail and yellow fur on head and throat. They are Canada's largest bat (13-16 in wingspan, 5-6 in long, 1.2 oz) and are widely distributed throughout Canada and the United States. They are the only bat found in **Hawaii**.

[Hoary Bats](/animals/hoarybat/) roost in **trees**, often evergreens, coming out at night to hunt flying insects. They raise their young in the north in the summer but migrate south for the winter. They are solitary creatures.

**Did you know?** The females bear two young in late June. The young stay in the tree while their mother goes out hunting for food.
