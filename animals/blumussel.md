Blue Mussel can be found in the **shallow waters** of the Arctic, North Pacific, and Atlantic oceans. They have a long, triangular, hinged **shell** with rounded edges. The shell is usually **blue/black** and less than 3 in long. They attach themselves to a rock or dock in calm, sheltered areas, often forming large clusters. They filter plankton, bacteria, and small waste particles from the water.

**California Mussel** are larger (up to 10 in) and have a thicker shell with ribbed lines radiating out from the hinge. They are found in more exposed areas than Blue Mussels. **Hooked Mussel**, found in West Atlantic oyster beds, have a sharp curve at one end.

[Clam](/{{section}}/clam) are related to Mussels but don't attach themselves to a surface, are usually rounder than Mussels, and can be found closer to the surface.

**Did you know?** Blue Mussels can withstand freezing temperatures for several months.
