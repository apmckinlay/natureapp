Badgers have **short, stout bodies** (22-30 in long), short legs, and long claws for rapid digging. They have a long **triangular head** with a tipped-up nose and small ears. They have grayish-brown fur on their back, a **black face with white patches** on the cheeks, a **white stripe** along the nose to the shoulders, and dark feet. They prefer open **grassland** with sandy soil and can be hard to spot as they are active at **night**.

Badgers have excellent vision, sharp hearing, and a strong sense of smell. They eat small prey and are **powerful diggers**, easily tunneling after rodents and snakes. They also dig large underground tunnels and burrows where they sleep, store food, and raise young.

**Did you know?** Badgers don't hibernate, but they do conserve energy by becoming much less active in winter.
