Pika are very vocal small mammals (7-8 in long) with **large ears** that can be found on rock faces and cliffs near mountain meadows **above the treeline** in western North America.

Pika have thick, peppery-brown fur that usually covers their very short tail. They use **high-pitched calls** and **whistles** to communicate and protect their territory. They eat grasses, weeds, and tall wildflowers, drying and stacking food for the winter and bringing it into their burrows once winter arrives.

Pika live in **colonies** but are very independent and defend their individual dens. They're active in **daytime** and don't hibernate in winter. Many breed twice, in spring and summer, giving birth to 2-6 young each time.

[Hoary Marmot](/animals/hoarymar) also live in the mountains above the treeline, but they are 3 times as large as Pika.

**Did you know?** Pika, also known as Rock Rabbit or Coney, are closely related to **Rabbits**, despite looking like a Hamster.
