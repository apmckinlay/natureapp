The Nature Companion website and app are designed to help you find out more about common plants and animals in Canada’s four western provinces.

From the home page, click on a category (e.g. Birds) to see an overview of the entries for that category. Click on an entry (e.g. Crow) to see a larger photograph and additional information.

If you are on a category page (e.g. Birds), you can narrow down the entries you will see by toggling the locations and habitats that you want to see (e.g. SK, forest).

Click on the icon at the top left of a page to go up a level, e.g. from an entry to a category, or from a category to the home page.

Click on the **X** at the top right to go back to the previous page.

If you’re on a phone or tablet, you can swipe across the screen to move between categories or entries.

### Searching

To get to the Search page, click on the magnifying glass in the top right corner of most pages.

Type in your search query (e.g. red hawk) and hit Enter or click on the magnifying glass beside the search box.

You can narrow down the results by toggling the locations, habitats, and categories that you want to see (e.g. SK, Birds).

### Installing

Nature Companion can be accessed from your phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Once you have accessed it once across the internet, you should be able to access it even when you're offline (depending on your device, browser, and storage space).

To make it easier to access, you can install Nature Companion on your phone or tablet by following the instructions below (Note: You should be online when you install).

To uninstall, follow the usual process for uninstalling apps.

#### Installing on iPhone / iPad

Go to Nature Companion (https://www.naturecompanion.ca/) on your browser (Safari).

Tap the share <img src="/images/share.png" height="20px" /> button (center bottom on an iPhone, top right on an iPad) and scroll down until you see **Add to Home Screen**. Choose it and then choose **Add** on the pop-up.

If you don't see the **Add to Home Screen** option, but there is a Safari icon <img src="/images/safari.png" height="20px" /> next to the Share button that means you're not actually in Safari (e.g. you clicked on the link from your email program). Tap the Safari button first, that will take you to Safari where the Share menu should have the **Add to Home Screen** option.

When using Nature Companion offline you may get a pop-up saying **Turn Off Airplane Mode or Use Wi-Fi to Access Data**, but you can click **OK** and continue.

#### Installing on Android

Go to Nature Companion (https://www.naturecompanion.ca/) on your browser (Chrome).

Tap the three dots at the top right, choose **Add to Home Screen**, and then choose **Add** on the pop-up.
