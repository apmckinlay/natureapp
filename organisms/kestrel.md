American Kestrel
================

**Less than a foot long** with a wingspan under 2 ft, American Kestrels are **North America’s smallest falcon**. They’re colorful birds with reddish-brown bodies, a pale belly, and two vertical black stripes on either side of their white cheeks. The **males** have a blue-gray head and wings. 

American Kestrel can be found **year-round** in the central and southern United States. In the **summer**, you can spot them  in Canada, Alaska, and the northern plains of Minnesota, Montana, and North Dakota. The migrating birds **winter** in the southern United States (Florida, Louisiana, Texas).

Kestrel hunt for insects, small rodents, and birds in **open grassy or desert areas** with few trees. They nest in holes of trees, rocks, or buildings. Look for them perched on fence posts and utility poles or hovering over a field on rapidly beating wings.

**Merlin** are larger, bulkier, and browner without the black slashes on the head. Sharp-shinned Hawk have broader wings, longer tail, and more defined markings on their chest. **Mourning Dove** are pale brown with a small head and long, pointed tail.

**Did you know?** If Kestrel kill more than they can eat, they hide the excess in holes or under grass clumps and tree roots for days when they’re less successful.
