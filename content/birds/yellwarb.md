Yellow Warbler are small (4.7-5.1 in), **yellow** birds with darker wings and tail. They are the only larger warbler with **yellow** (not white) **spots** on the **tail**. The **males** are a brighter yellow with reddish streaks on their chest. 

Yellow Warbler can often be heard singing from the tops of willows or other small trees along streams or in wetlands. They spend their summers in Alaska, all Canadian provinces and territories, and in all parts of the United States except for the southern Gulf states.

**American Goldfinch** have shorter, thicker beaks and a more deeply notched tail. [Wilson's Warbler]({{< ref "wilswarb.md" >}}) are smaller and have a black cap.

**Did you know?** The Brown-headed Cowbird often lays its eggs in a Yellow Warbler's nest. The Yellow Warbler responds by building another nest on top of the old one. Sometimes there are 6 nests one on top of another.
