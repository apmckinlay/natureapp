Townsend's Warblers are small songbirds (4.7 in) with a **yellow** **face** and **chest** and a **dark cap** and **eye patch**. They have a **white** belly, undertail, and wingbars. 

Townsend's Warblers spend their **summers** in the coniferous **forests** of the Pacific Northwest from Alaska to Oregon. Some **winter** along the coast of California while others head further south to Mexico and Central America.

Townsend's Warbler search for **insects** in the **tops of trees**. The **males** head north in late May and establish their territory by singing from the tops of trees. 

**Black-throated Green Warblers** have a gray chest and only a small, pale gray patch around their eyes.

**Did you know?** The females sometimes start a nest in one tree and then move all the materials to another tree to finish the nest there.
