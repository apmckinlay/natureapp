California Gulls can be found in **summer** on inland lakes and marshes from southern NWT through AB, SK, southwest MB, and the northern parts of Montana and North Dakota. In **winter** they can be found along the Pacific coast. Some can be found **year-round** in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. They **breed on islands** and levees on inland lakes and rivers and **forage in any open area**, from farms and pastures to garbage dumps.

Gulls are long-winged, white birds with gray and black markings. It can be difficult to tell them apart as they take **up to 4 years to develop their adult plumage**. In addition, gulls often mate with each other, so there are **hybrids** with characteristics of two species.

California Gull are a **medium-sized** bird (18.5-21 in) with a long yellow bill with a **black band** and a **red spot** near the tip.

[Herring Gull]({{< ref "herrgull.md" >}}) are larger than California Gull with a thicker beak. [Ring-billed Gull]({{< ref "ringgull.md" >}}) are smaller with thinner bills that don't have a red dot.

**Did you know?** Young California Gulls learn how to catch food by dropping a stick in mid-air and swooping down to catch it.
