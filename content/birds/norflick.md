Northern Flicker are a **fairly large** woodpecker (11-14 in) but, unlike other woodpeckers, they are often found **on the ground** foraging for ants and beetles. They also **sit on tree branches** rather than leaning against the trunk.

Northern Flicker have a brown body with black markings, a **black bib**, and a **white patch **on their **rump**. The underside of their wing and tail feathers is bright **yellow** for **eastern** birds and **red** for **western** birds.

Northern Flicker are widespread throughout Alaska, Canada, and the United States. **Northern** **birds** migrate south for the **winter**. They're most commonly found in open woods, forest edges, or urban areas with lots of trees.

**Red-bellied Woodpecker** are black and white with a red patch on their head and neck.

**Did you know?** Northern Flicker clean their feathers by taking dust baths or rubbing a crushed ant against their feathers (formic acid kills small parasites).
