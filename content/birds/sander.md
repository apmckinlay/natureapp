You're most likely to spot small flocks of Sanderling (7-8 in) in their pale **winter** plumage - light gray above and white below with black legs and beak - chasing the waves and probing the sand for crabs and other small crustaceans on the beaches of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts. 

In **summer**, Sanderling breed on islands above the Arctic Circle on dry rocky tundra close to lakes or ponds.

[Dunlin]({{< ref "dunlin.md" >}}) are larger than Sanderling with a longer, downcurved bill. [Piping Plover]({{< ref "pipplov.md" >}}) are smaller, stay higher up on the beach, and don't chase waves. **Western Sandpiper** are smaller and browner than Sanderling.

**Did you know?** After eating, Sanderling will often regurgitate pellets of sand and mollusk and crustacean shells.
