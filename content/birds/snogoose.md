Huge flocks of Snow Geese heading south or north are a sure sign that the seasons are changing. Snow Goose are medium-sized geese (27-33 in, 54 in wingspan) with a long, thick neck. Most of them are **white** with black wingtips and a dark line along their pink bill. However, some, known as the **Blue Goose**, are gray-brown with a white head and white under the tail.

Snow Geese spend their **summers** on the high Arctic tundra, using the four major North American flyways (Atlantic, Pacific, Mississippi, Central) to head south to the coastal marshes and wetlands of the west coast, the Gulf Coast, the south-central interior of the USA, and a short stretch of the central Atlantic coast for the **winter**. A few birds spend the winter in BC's Lower Mainland.

Snow Geese eat **grasses** and can often be spotted grazing for leftover **grain** in farm fields. They root in the mud for food so their **faces** are often stained a rusty orange.

Domestic geese and ducks have orange bills and feet and no black wing feathers. **Ross's Goose** are smaller. **Tundra**, **Trumpeter**, and **Mute Swans** are much larger with longer necks and no black wingtips.
