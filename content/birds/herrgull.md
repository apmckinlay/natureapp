Herring Gull are one of the most familiar gulls of the **North Atlantic** and can be found along both North American coasts in **winter**. They are found **year-round** along the southern coast of Alaska, around the Great Lakes, along the St. Lawrence River, and on the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Newfoundland.

Gulls are long-winged, white birds with gray and black markings. It can be difficult to tell them apart as they take **up to 4 years to develop their adult plumage**. In addition, gulls often mate with each other, so there are **hybrids** with characteristics of two species.

Herring Gull are **large** birds (22-26 in long) with a **red spot** near the tip of the lower half of their **large yellow bill**. In flight, they look **barrel-chested** and **broad-winged** compared to smaller species.

Herring Gull are loud and competitive scavengers, spending much of their time perched near food sources. They also eat large numbers of **aquatic** and **marine animals** and **berries**. They drop __Clams__ and other shellfish on exposed rocks or parking lots in order to break the shells and get at the soft interior.

[California Gull]({{< ref "calgull.md" >}}) and [Ring-billed Gull]({{< ref "ringgull.md" >}}) are much smaller. [Glaucous-winged Gull]({{< ref "glaugull.md" >}}) have a stockier body, shorter wings, and a thicker bill.

**Did you know?** If necessary, Herring Gull can drink seawater, excreting the salt through glands over the eyes.
