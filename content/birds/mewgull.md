Mew Gull (also known as Common Gull and Asia) are **one of the smallest** (16-18 in) **white-headed** gulls. They are common along Pacific coast beaches in **winter** but spend **summers** in Alaska and northwestern Canada around lakes in the northern forest. They can be found **year-round** along the coast of BC and southern Alaska.

Gulls are long-winged, white birds with gray and black markings. It can be difficult to tell them apart as they take **up to 4 years to develop their adult plumage**. In addition, gulls often mate with each other, so there are **hybrids** with characteristics of two species.

The Mew Gull have an **unmarked yellow bill**, **yellow legs**, and black wing tips with white spots.

**Did you know?** Mew Gull often perch in __Spruce__ trees and may even build their nest in trees.
