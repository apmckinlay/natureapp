Black Turnstone are short-legged shorebirds (9-10 in). They have a dark body, legs, and beak. The **chest** is dark with dark spots right above the **white belly**. Breeding adults have a **white eyebrow** and a **white patch** under their eye. The **white stripes** on their **wings** are visible when flying.

Black Turnstone use their beaks to pry __Limpet__ and other mollusks from the rocks and poke their beak inside **Acorn Barnacle** to tear them apart. In the **summer**, they eat berries and insects and lay their eggs in grassy patches along the coast.

Black Turnstone breed along the coast of Alaska in **summer**, spending their **winters** along the Pacific coast from Alaska to Baja California.

**Did you know?** Black Turnstone are very aggressive when breeding and will fly more than 100 miles from their territory to chase away Gulls and Jaegers.
