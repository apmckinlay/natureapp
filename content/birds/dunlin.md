Dunlin (6-9 in) are shorebirds with long black legs and a **long drooping black bill**. Their **winte**r coat is plain with a brown back and pale belly, but in **summer** the **rusty-red** feathers on their **back** and **head** and a **black patch** on their **white belly** are noticeable. In flight, large flocks turn and bank in unison.

Dunlin spend the **summer** breeding season on the wet coastal tundra of northern Alaska, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. They **winter** along the Pacific, Gulf, and Atlantic coastal mudflats and estuaries as far north as New England and southern Alaska.

**Did you know?** Dunlin breeding in northern Alaska migrate down the eastern side of Siberia and Asia to Japan and China.
