American Tree Sparrow are small plump birds (5 ½ in) with long thin tails. They have a **rusty-brown cap** and a **rusty-brown stripe** through their **eye**. Their **bill** is **black above** and **yellow below **and they often have a **dark spot** in the **centre of their chest**. 


In spite of their name, Tree Sparrow spend their life on the **ground**, looking for food and building a nest.

Tree Sparrow winter farther north than other sparrows, spending their **summers** near the tree line in Alaska and northern Canada and their **winters** in the northern United States and the southern edge of Canada.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chipping Sparrow</span> have a black stripe through their eye. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Song Sparrow</span> have a heavily streaked breast. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">House Sparrow</span>, introduced to North America in 1851, are chunkier with a shorter tail and stouter beak (5.9-6.7 in).

**Did you know?** Tree Sparrow need to eat 30% of their body weight in food and a similar amount in water every day. A single day with no food or water is usually a death sentence.
