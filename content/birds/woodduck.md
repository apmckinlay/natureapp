**Male** Wood Duck sport shiny blue, green, and purple stripes with white stripes on the head and chin in **summer**. **Females** and **juveniles** are brownish-gray with a large white patch around the eye. The birds (18-21 in) have a **boxy crested head**, a **thin neck**, and a **long broad tail**.

Wood Duck prefer areas with a mix of water and forest, such as woodland ponds or river swamps. They perch and nest in trees and are comfortable flying through woods. They spend their summers in southern Canada and the northern USA. They can be found year-round along the west coast and in the southeastern USA.

The birds pair up in late winter and begin breeding in early spring. They eat mostly plant materials.

**Green-winged Teal** don't have bold white stripes. [Mallard]({{< ref "mallard.md" >}}) have much paler sides and don't have crest and white stripes.

**Did you know?** Wood Duck have strong claws that they use to grip bark and perch on branches. Very young ducklings must jump from high tree cavities to make their way to water.
