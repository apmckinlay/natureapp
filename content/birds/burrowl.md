Burrowing Owl are **tiny (9 in)** with long legs and a short tail. They are mottled brown with **white eyebrows** and **throat**. They are found during the summer in southwestern Canada and the western United States. Northern birds migrate further south for the winter. They can be found year-round in southern California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and the Florida Panhandle.

Burrowing Owl live in **treeless areas** with an open view and plenty of holes for shelter. Look for them standing on the ground next to their burrow or on a nearby fence post. You may see them near a __Prairie Dog__ colony as the owls use the abandoned burrows of __Prairie Dog__ and __Ground Squirrel__ for nests. 

Burrowing Owl turn their head upside down when curious and bob up and down when threatened.

Unlike many owl, Burrowing Owl are **active day and night. [Long-eared Owl]({{< ref "longowl.md" >}}),**, **Short-eared Owl**, and [Snowy Owl]({{< ref "snowyowl.md" >}}) also live in **grassland areas**, but they're all much larger than the Burrowing Owl. **Short-eared Owl** (15 in) are the most similar, but they have shorter legs, an obvious facial disc, and fly low over the fields rather than walking on the ground.

**Did you know?** Burrowing Owl often line the entrance to their burrows with animal dung to attract insects that they can catch and eat.
