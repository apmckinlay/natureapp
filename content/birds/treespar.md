American Tree Sparrow are small plump birds (5.5 in) with long thin tails. They have a **rusty-brown cap** and a **rusty-brown stripe** through their **eye**. Their **bill** is **black above** and **yellow below** and they often have a **dark spot** in the **centre of their chest**.

In spite of their name, Tree Sparrow spend their life on the **ground**, looking for food and building a nest.

Tree Sparrow winter farther north than other sparrows, spending their **summers** near the tree line in Alaska and northern Canada and their **winters** in the northern United States and the southern edge of Canada.

[Chipping Sparrow]({{< ref "chipspar.md" >}}) have a black stripe through their eye. [Song Sparrow]({{< ref "songspar.md" >}}) have a heavily streaked breast. [House Sparrow]({{< ref "houspar.md" >}}),, introduced to North America in 1851, are chunkier with a shorter tail and stouter beak (5.9-6.7 in).

**Did you know?** Tree Sparrow need to eat 30% of their body weight in food and a similar amount in water every day. A single day with no food or water is usually a death sentence.
