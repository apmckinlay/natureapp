Great Gray Owl can be found **year-round** in the **evergreen forests** of Alaska and Nnorthern Canada as well as the **western mountain region** stretching from BC through Washington, Idaho, Montana, and parts of California.

Great Gray Owl are the **tallest** (24-33 in) North American owl with the **largest wingspan** (53-60 in) but are mostly fluff and **only half the weight** of a [Snowy Owl]({{< ref "snowyowl.md" >}}) or [Great Horned Owl]({{< ref "grehowl.md" >}}).

They have **silvery gray** feathers, a round head with a **large facial disc**, a **black and white bowtie** across the neck, and **yellow** eyes and beak.

Great Gray Owl hunt for rodents and other small mammals during the **day**. They prefer a mix of **dense forest** for nesting and roosting and **open areas** (meadows, clearings) for hunting.
[Great Horned Owl]({{< ref "grehowl.md" >}}) hunt at night and have tufts of fur, like ears, on their head. [Northern Hawk Owl]({{< ref "norhowl.md" >}}) are also found in northern boreal forests, but they have a long tail and short pointed wings. **Barred Owl** are smaller with dark eyes and no black-and-white throat markings.

**Did you know?** Great Gray Owl have very good hearing and can detect prey under 2 ft of snow thanks to the facial disc feathers that channel sound to the ears.
