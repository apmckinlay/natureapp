This small songbird (4.5-5 in) spends its **summers** in the northern boreal forests from Alberta, around the Great Lakes, to the Maritimes. It **migrates** through the eastern United States to its **winter** home in the West Indies and Central America and occasionally at the southern tip of the Florida Panhandle.

**Males** have a **yellow throat** and **breast** with streaky black markings. **Orange-brown cheek patches** are less distinctive out of the breeding season. **Females** are grayer overall with a **pale yellow breast**. Both males and females have a **black stripe** through the **eye**.

The warblers favourite northern food is the **spruce budworm**, although it also eats other insects.

[Yellow-rumped Warblers]({{< ref "yellrump.md" >}}) have a long thin tail with bright yellow patches on face, sides, and rump.

**Did you know?** The Cape May Warbler has a curled, semitubular tongue that it uses to collect flower nectar in the Caribbean during the winter.
