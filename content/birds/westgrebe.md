Western Grebe are a medium-sized waterbird (22-30 in) with a **long, white neck**, a **black head** and **back**, and a **white underside**. They have a **long, thin, yellow bill** and red eyes.

Western Grebe **nest** in **colonies** on freshwater **lakes** and **marshes** in **western** Canada and the United States. Flocks **winter** along the **Pacific coast** in sheltered bays or estuaries. Some birds may live **year-round** in the southwest.

The birds dive from the surface, **swimming underwater** to catch **fish**, thrusting their neck forward and spearing it with their bill.

**Nests** are usually built on floating vegetation.

**Did you know?** The young climb onto their parent's back minutes after hatching. The bare yellow skin on top of their head turns bright red when they are begging for food or separated from their parents.
