The largest North American owl (20-28 in, 50-57 in wingspan), Snowy Owl have a round head and yellow eyes in a **white facial disc**. **Males** can be pure white, but **females** have mixed white and brown feathers.

Snowy Owl prefer **treeless, wide-open spaces**. The islands high above the Arctic Circle are their **summer** breeding grounds. Some can be found **year-round** along the northern Arctic coast from Alaska to Labrador, while others head further south into Canada and the northern United States in **winter**. Some years large numbers will appear south of the Canadian border in search of food.

Fence posts, hay bales, and other **perches** provide good look-out spots for Snowy Owl as they hunt for small animals, including Lemming and Ptarmigan. They often **sit on the ground** so they prefer hilly ground where they'll have a good view.

**Barn Owl** are smaller, browner, and nocturnal. **Gyrfalcon** are smaller and slender with a long tail

**Did you know?** Snowy Owl hunt both day and night, perhaps because they've adapted to almost day-long sunlight in the Arctic.
