Sandhill Crane are a large **gray** bird (3-4 ft) with a **long neck** and **legs** and a wingspan of 5-6.5 ft. Adults have **pale cheeks** and a **crimson cap**, and the feathers may be stained rusty red, possibly from feeding and preening in muddy areas. They have a **loud trumpeting call**; their long windpipe gives it a lower pitch and harmonics.

Sandhill Crane breed and forage in the **grasslands** and **wetlands** of Alaska, central and western Canada, and the northern United States during the **summer**. They spend **winters** in the southern United States. There are small **year-round** populations in Florida and Mississippi.

Sandhill Crane travel in **flocks** with their **necks outstretched** and can often be heard before they are seen. [Great Blue Heron]({{< ref "grebluher.md" >}}) fly solo and tuck their neck over their back. __Whooping Crane__ are larger and white.

**Did you know?** Sandhill Crane can live for up to 36 years. They mate for life, often waiting until they are 7 to start breeding. Juveniles stay close to their parents for 9-10 months.
