A **very large** hawk (21-23 in) with a 5 to 6 ft wingspan, Osprey spend their **summers** on the rivers, lakes, and coast of Alaska, Canada, and the Rocky Mountains of the northern United States. If you're lucky, you'll spot an Osprey plunging feet-first into a lake to catch a fish in its claws. They **winter** along the coast of southern California and the Gulf of Mexico.

Osprey are **brown above** and **white below** with a **white head** and a **brown stripe** across the **eyes** and **cheeks**. When they **fly**, there is a distinctive **kink in their wings** in the shape of an M.

Osprey build **large stick nests** near water on poles or dead trees. They lay 2-3 eggs per year. The first chick hatches almost 5 days before the last one and the mother stays with the young until they're ready to fly (50-55 days).

[Bald Eagle]({{< ref "baldeagle.md" >}}) frequent similar habitats, but they are larger, stockier, and don't have the Osprey's clean white underparts.

**Did you know?** Osprey have gripping pads on their feet to help them hold and carry fish for long distances. They are the only North American hawk to eat live fish.
