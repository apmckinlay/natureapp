American Dipper (also known as a Water Ouzel) are commonly found **perched on a rock** in the middle of a rushing **mountain stream**. A stocky, medium-sized gray bird (5.5-8 in), they're constantly **bobbing up and down**. They catch aquatic insects by **diving**, **swimming**, or **walking in streams**. An extra eyelid enables them to see underwater.

Dipper can be found **year-round** in fast-moving, unpolluted mountain streams in northwestern North America.

**Did you know?** Dipper are able to survive in cold water during the winter due to their low metabolic rate, extra oxygen-carrying capacity in their blood, and a thick coat of feathers.
