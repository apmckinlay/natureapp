**Dark gray** above and **light** **gray** below with a **black patch** on the back of their head and a white cap and throat, Gray Jay (also known as Camp Robber, Canada Jay, Whiskey Jack) are a familiar visitor to **campgrounds** in the **evergreen forests** of Alaska, Canada, and the mountains of the western United States. 

Gray Jay are highly **curious** and always on the lookout for **food**, anything from berries to small animals to handouts from hikers. You'll usually find them in **small flocks**.

Gray Jay are 10-13 in with a wingspan of 18 in. They have a round head, a short bill, and a long tail. They live **year-round** in the northern forests and **nest in late winter**, incubating eggs at temperatures that may drop below minus 20F.

Gray Jay and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Steller's Jay</span> share the same habitat but are easy to tell apart as the Steller's Jay has a black head and dark blue body.

**Did you know?** Gray Jay store large quantities of food in bark crevices to eat in winter and use sticky saliva to glue small food items to tree branches.
