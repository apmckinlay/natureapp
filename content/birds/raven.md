The Common Raven can be found **year-round** in almost every part of North America except for the eastern forests and central grasslands. They're less common in cities but can be found around **farms** and **small towns**.

Ravens are large black birds (22-27 in) with a wide range of calls. They are **solitary** birds and **acrobatic** flyers, alternately soaring, gliding, and flapping. You may spot them cruising highways looking for roadkill. They **eat almost anything**: seeds, fruit, insects, small birds and animals, garbage.

Ravens are very clever. They play games, hunt cooperatively, and understand cause and effect (e.g. looking for a carcass when they hear a gunshot but ignoring similar noises).

**Chihuahuan Raven** are smaller, more social and are found at lower elevations in the southwestern desert rather than in higher-elevation forests.

**Is it a [Crow]({{< ref "crow.md" >}}) or a Raven?** Ravens are larger than [Crows]({{< ref "crow.md" >}}) with longer wings and heavier beaks. Ravens have a wedge-shaped tail; [Crows]({{< ref "crow.md" >}}) have a short, square tail. Ravens have a ruff of feathers on their throat; [Crows]({{< ref "crow.md" >}}) don't. Ravens are solitary and are not normally found in urban areas; [Crows]({{< ref "crow.md" >}}) are seen in larger groups and are often found in cities. Ravens glide, whereas [Crows]({{< ref "crow.md" >}}) rhythmically flap their wings.
