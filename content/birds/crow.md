American Crows are large (16-21 in) black birds with a thick neck and long legs. They can be found **year-round** in most parts of the United States. Birds spending the **summer** further north in Canada and the north-central United States **winter** a short distance south. They can be found in forests, grasslands, wetlands, and urban areas.

Crows have a **loud "caw caw" call** and **thrive around people**. They **eat almost anything** - from seeds and nuts to insects and garbage. They are **sociable**, congregating in large numbers and sleeping in communal roosts in winter. They are **very clever** and can make and use tools.

The **Northwestern Crow** is very similar (smaller with hoarser voice) and may be related; it's only found along the west coast of Canada and Alaska. **Fish Crow** (14-16 in) are found around water on the east coast of the United States.

**Is it a Crow or a [Raven]({{< ref "raven.md" >}})?** [Ravens]({{< ref "raven.md" >}}) are larger than Crows with longer wings and heavier beaks. [Ravens]({{< ref "raven.md" >}}) have a wedge-shaped tail; Crows have a short, square tail. [Ravens]({{< ref "raven.md" >}}) have a ruff of feathers on their throat; Crows don't. [Ravens]({{< ref "raven.md" >}}) are solitary and are not normally found in urban areas; Crows are seen in larger groups and are often found in cities. [Ravens]({{< ref "raven.md" >}}) glide, whereas Crows rhythmically flap their wings.
