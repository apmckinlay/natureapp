Listen for the **haunting cry** of the Common Loon on quiet, forested northern lakes in **summer**  when they have a black head and throat, a long (3 ft), flat, black and white checkered body, with a white belly and striped collar. In **winter**, they're gray with a white throat and can be found be found on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.

The **monogamous** birds build nests in hidden spots along the lake. They are **strong swimmers** and **divers** but awkward on land, only going ashore to mate and incubate eggs.

**Red-throated Loon** and **Pacific Loon** are smaller with a narrower bill and no obvious collar.

**Did you know?** Loon parents and two chicks can eat half a ton of fish over a 15-week period.
