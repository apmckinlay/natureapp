Just 6 in tall, the Downy Woodpecker is **North America's smallest woodpecker** and is found **year-round** in forests and cities throughout North America. They are **boldly patterned in black and white** with a white belly, a white stripe down the back, a striped head, and checkered wings. **Males** have a small red patch on the back of their head.

Downy Woodpecker are very active, **acrobatic** birds and will hang upside down to look for **insects**. You may hear their high-pitched call or them drumming on wood to hollow out a nest cavity. They join mixed flocks of birds in the winter.

**Hairy Woodpecker** have similar markings but are much larger (7-10 in) and have a longer bill (almost as long as the Hairy Woodpecker's head).

**Did you know?** The woodpeckers' chisel-shaped beak is designed to dig holes in wood while their long, barbed tongue can search crevices for food.
