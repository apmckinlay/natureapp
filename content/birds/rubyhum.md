Ruby-throated Hummingbirds have a **shiny green** **back** and **crown** with a gray-white belly. **Males** have a **ruby-red throat**. These slender, tiny birds (2.8-3.5 in) have a slightly **downcurved** beak and **short wings**.

Ruby-throated Hummingbirds live in **woodland** areas as well as **urban gardens** with lots of flowering plants. They are the only hummingbird species to breed in **eastern North America** but can also be found in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. They fly south to Central America every **winter**, crossing the 800 km expanse of the Gulf of Mexico. A few over-winter on the Gulf coast or at the tip of Florida.

Ruby-throated Hummingbird beat their wings 53 times a second. They can hover in place and change direction extremely fast.

Male [Anna's Hummingbirds]({{< ref "annas.md" >}}) have glittering red foreheads as well as throats. Male **Black-chinned Hummingbirds** have a black chin with a purple strip at the base, while the females have longer wings that reach the tip of their tails.

**Did you know?** Ruby-throated Hummingbirds have very short legs and can neither hop nor walk, although they can shuffle sideways when perched.
