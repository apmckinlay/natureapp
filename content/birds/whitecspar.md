White-crowned Sparrow (5.9-6.3 in long) have a gray breast, a black-and-white striped head, and a pale beak. They prefer open areas with trees or shrubs nearby.

White-crowned Sparrow spend the summer in Alaska, northern Canada, and the mountains of British Columbia, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. Birds along the Pacific coast and in parts of the western interior don't migrate.
