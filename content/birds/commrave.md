Common Raven can be found **year-round** in almost every part of North America except for the eastern forests and central grasslands. They're less common in cities than the __Crow__ but can be found around **farms** and **small towns**.

Ravens are large black birds (22-27 in). They have a **larger bill** and a **shaggier throat** than the __Crow__, and their tail is **wedge-shaped** rather than square. They also have a wider range of calls.

Ravens are **solitary** birds, unlike the sociable Crow, and **acrobatic** flyers, alternately soaring, gliding, and flapping. You may spot them cruising highways looking for roadkill. They **eat almost anything**: seeds, fruit, insects, small birds and animals, garbage.

**Chihuahuan Raven** are smaller, more social and are found at lower elevations in the southwestern desert rather than in higher-elevation forests.

**Did you know?** Ravens are very clever. They play games, hunt cooperatively, and understand cause and effect (e.g. looking for a carcass when they hear a gunshot but ignoring similar noises).
