With their **pink head** and **chest**, **male** Pine Grosbeak are easy to identify as they gather around **bird feeders** for sunflowers in **winter**. The **females** are grayer with **yellow** or **pink shading** on their **head** and **rump**. Both are plump-chested (8-10 in) with **2 white wingbars**. Their **thick, stubby, dark beak** easily crushes seeds and nips buds and needles off trees.

Pine Grosbeak can be found **year-round** in the **forests** of Alaska, Canada (particularly the north and mountain regions), and the mountain regions of the western United States. They travel in **flocks** in **winter**, travelling further south to Alberta, Saskatchewan, the north-central United States, and the Great Lakes region. They feast in **large flocks** on **fruit trees** such as __Rowan__ (Mountain Ash) until the tree is bare. They are slow-moving birds and allow people to come close.

[Evening Grosbeak]({{< ref "evengros.md" >}}) have a shorter tail and a large pale bill. **House Finch** are smaller with a pale bill and streakier coloring; the male is redder. [White-winged Crossbill]({{< ref "whitewcbill.md" >}}) have a cross-tipped bill, are smaller with a shorter tail, and females are streakier.

**Did you know?** Pine Grosbeak eat fruit by biting through and discarding the pulp before crushing the seed.
