**Dusky Grouse** and **Sooty Grouse** (previously known as **Blue Grouse**) are large (16-20 in), chicken-like birds, light to dark **gray** with a **black tail**. The **bare skin** on the side of the male's **neck** is purplish-red in **Dusky Grouse** and yellow in **Sooty Grouse**.

Blue Grouse eat **leaves**, **buds**, and **conifer needles**. **Sooty Grouse** are found in **forested** areas near the Pacific coast and in the interior of northern California. **Dusky Grouse** are found in the western interior. During the **summer**, they can be found in dry grasslands, shrublands or mountainous forests. They spend their winters in coniferous forests.

**Did you know?** Birds of a specific species tend to have the same number of tail feathers (usually around 10). However, Dusky Grouse can have anywhere from 15 to 22.
