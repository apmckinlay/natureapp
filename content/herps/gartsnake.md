Garter Snake are **long** (1.5-4.5 ft), **slender** snakes and usually have **3 stripes** on their **back**. There are, however, many regional variations in appearance. For example, **Terrestrial Gartersnake**, found in northern Arizona, have one creamy stripe down their back.

Garter Snake are highly adaptable and can be found throughout **North America** although they prefer **moist, grassy places** so they're less common in the dry southwestern states.

Many Garter Snake hibernate in large communal sites called **hibernacula**, lying together in tight coils to stay warm. They give birth to live young from June to September.

Garter Snake can be found on rocks or paths, **basking in the sun**, on warm days. They are often found **near water** where they can find frogs and toads to eat.

**Did you know?** Some Garter Snake are strong swimmers and may even hunt in water.
