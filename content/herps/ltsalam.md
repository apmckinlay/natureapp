Long-toed Salamander have a **long fourth toe** on their **hind feet**. They have dark-gray to black, **wet-looking skin** with a **patchy yellow stripe** running down their **back**. They are 1.5-3.5 in long with **large bulging eyes** and a **blunt nose** and can be found from the Alaska Panhandle south through Oregon and east to Idaho and Montana.

Long-toed Salamander are **nocturnal** and spend most of their time underground, often in rodent burrows. The easiest time to spot them is during breeding season. They prefer **valley bottoms** and **moist forests** not far from water. They lay their eggs before the ice has disappeared in large, shallow lakes and ponds with boggy edges.

Long-toed Salamander eat insects, tadpoles, worms, and beetles. In colder areas, they hibernate in groups underground in winter.

**Did you know?** The Long-toed Salamander's tail serves two purposes. It stores fat for the salamander to use as food during hard times and, if a predator tries to bite the tail, it receives a mouthful of sticky poison.
