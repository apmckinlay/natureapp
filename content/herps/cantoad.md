Canadian Toad, also known as **Dakota Toad**, (1.5-3 in) are gray-green or brown with brownish-red warts. Unlike other toads found in the same area, they have **gray spots** on a **light-colored belly** and the **raised ridges** on their **head** join to form a **bump** between their eyes.

Canadian Toad are found in **river valleys** and around **lakes** in the **grasslands**, **aspen parklands**, and **boreal forest** of the Canadian prairies and south to the Dakotas and Minnesota.

Canadian Toad are easiest to spot in the spring when they congregate at breeding ponds. The males call to the females with a **high-pitched trill** that repeats every 15-20 seconds. Once breeding season is over, the toads spread out into the grasslands and aspen parklands, although they generally stay **close to water**. Their mottled earthy colors are good camouflage.

**Did you know?** Canadian Toad hibernate underground below the frost line in burrows they've dug using the bony lumps on their rear legs.
