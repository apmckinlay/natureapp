Western Toad are 2-5 in long, green or brown, with a **light-colored stripe** down their **back** and a light-colored belly. The **warty bumps** on their skin are **reddish-brown** and sometimes surrounded by **black** rings. Western Toads are found around ponds, lakes, streams, and marshes in the **Yukon** and **NWT**, along the **Pacific coast**, and **inland** to **western Montana** and **northern New Mexico**. Unlike many other toads, the Western Toad can be found in the **mountains** above the snow line. 

Western Toad migrate considerable distances - over 4 miles - between their breeding ponds, upland summer ranges, and winter hibernation spots. All the members of a local population tend to lay their eggs in the same spot every year. The males make a **quiet peeping sound** to attract females.

**Did you know?** Western Toads walk rather than hop. When threatened, they inflate themselves with air and rise up on their legs.
