Western Skink are **long**, **narrow** lizards (8 in) with **smooth**, **shiny scales**, a **pointed head**, and **short legs**. The **tail**, especially in young Skink, is bright **blue**. They have a dark brown body, a light-colored belly, and **4 creamy stripes** running from **head to tail**. The chin and side of the face often have an orange tint during breeding season.

When they aren't hunting for insects or sunning themselves, Western Skink stay under cover - either in a burrow or under leaves, logs, or rocks. They hibernate over winter in communal dens, often with lizards or snakes as well as other skinks.

Western Skink are found in **south-central BC** **south** to **Baja California** and **east** to **Montana**, **Utah**, and **Arizona**. They can be found in **grasslands** and **forested** areas where there is plenty of **plant cove**r as well as on south-facing slopes or rocks during their winter hibernation.

If attacked, Western Skink can cast off their tail. The tail continues to wiggle, distracting the predator, and giving the skink a chance to escape. The tail will grow back, but it will be darker and less evenly shaped.

**Many-lined Skink** are found on the central Great Plains of the United States. They have more stripes and a longer tail.

**Did you know?** Female skinks lay 2-6 eggs in July or August. Unlike other lizards, they stay with their eggs, protect them from predators, maintain the nest, and even lie on the eggs to keep them warm.
