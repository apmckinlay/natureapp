Painted Turtles are one of North America's most **common** turtles and can be found from **southern Canada to northern Mexico**. They have **red markings** on the edge of a **dark shell** (3.5-10 in long) and bright **yellow streaks** on their **head**, **neck**, **tail**, and **legs**. 

Painted Turtle live in slow-moving, shallow water, such as **ponds** or **marshes**. You can often spot them **sunning** themselves on a rock or log in the middle of a pond.  In colder climates, they hibernate over the winter in the muddy bottoms of ponds or lakes.

The females dig holes on land to lay their eggs. The young hatch in the fall, although in northern regions they overwinter in the nest to emerge in the spring.

Different sub-species of Painted Turtle have different markings on their lower shells. **Western Painted Turtle** are the most common and have bright red markings on their lower shell. _Red-eared Slider_ are similar in appearance to the Painted Turtle but have a red patch on the sides of their head.

**Did you know?** Painted Turtle use horny plates in place of teeth to grasp their food - aquatic plants, insects, small fish or snails, and dead animal matter.
