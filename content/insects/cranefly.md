Crane Fly look like giant mosquitoes, which is unfortunate, as they don't bite. They can also be mistaken for Harvestman (Daddy Long Legs) as they have very long, fragile legs that break off quite easily. Crane Flies have a narrow **body**, long narrow **wings**, and 6 legs. Different species vary greatly in color and size.

The legless, worm-like larvae are rarely seen, spending their time in moist soil, in sand along streams, or in rotting vegetation.

**Did you know?** Crane Fly only live for a few days. They mate, lay eggs for next season's flies, and then die. They may drink some dew or sugary flower nectar, but they eat next to nothing.
