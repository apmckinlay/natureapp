Spiders have 8 legs and 2 body parts, unlike insects that have 6 legs, 3 body parts, and antennae. Fishing Spider are found **near ponds** and **lakes** where they feed on insects, tadpoles, and even small fish. They can also be found in **wooded areas** and sometimes inside houses.

Fishing Spider are large **brownish-gray** spiders (1-3 in, including legs) with black and brown stripes on their back and legs.

Fishing Spider can run across the surface of the water and dive for prey. If an insect falls in the water, the spider can feel the vibrations as the insect struggles to escape and will rush to catch it. They can remain underwater for several minutes as their bristly hairs trap air bubbles that they use to breathe.
