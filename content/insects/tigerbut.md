Tiger Swallowtail butterflies (2.5 - 3.5 in wingspan) are one of North America's most familiar butterflies. They have yellow **wings** with a black border and wide black stripes. They can be found in **open woodlands** or tundra areas with stunted trees from central Alaska east across Canada and the Great Lakes to northern New England.

The mature **caterpillars** are dark green with two spots that look like eyes. They eat the leaves of Willow, Cherry, Poplar, and Ash. The butterflies eat flower nectar.

In different areas you will find the **Canadian**, **Eastern**, and **Western Tiger Swallowtails** as well as **Two-tailed** and **Pale Swallowtails**. They are similar in appearance and behavior with some minor differences.

**Did you know?** Tiger Swallowtails are avid mud puddlers (as are Yellow Sulfur), often gathering in large groups around mud puddles and jostling each other for position. Scientists believe they are after the salt.
