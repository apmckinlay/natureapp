Skimming low over slow-moving water, such as streams, ponds, and lakes, Damselfly are found throughout North America. They have a long thin abdomen (2.5-3 in), large eyes, and 2 pairs of **wings** with a wingspan of .7 to 7.5 in.

Damselfly are smaller with slimmer bodies than [Dragonfly]({{< ref "dragonfly.md" >}}). They hold their **wings close together** above their body when resting, whereas [Dragonfly]({{< ref "dragonfly.md" >}}) spread their wings apart.

Damselfly lay their eggs on aquatic plants. The nymphs live underwater, emerging as adults throughout spring, summer, and fall.

**Did you know?** Damselfly catch insects by extending a long hinged lower lip. They hold the prey between their legs so that they can eat while flying.
