Rubber Boa have small, smooth scales giving them a **shiny, loose skin** that resembles rubber. They are **small** (1-2.5 ft) and **thick-bodied** with a light-brown back and a pale yellow belly. A **small cap** on the **blunt tail** makes it hard to distinguish head from tail.

Rubber Boa can be found from **southern British Columbia** to **California** and as far **east** as **Idaho**, **western Utah**, and **Montana**. They don't tolerate heat as well as other snakes and prefer **cool, moist areas**. They prefer **sandy soils** where they can burrow.

Rubber Boa are **nocturnal** and rarely seen. They specialize in squeezing and eating baby rodents, consuming whole nests when they find them.

**Did you know?** If threatened, Rubber Boa roll into a ball, hide their head, and raise their tail into the air as a decoy.
