Pacific Tree Frog are **small** (1-2 in long) frogs with **long, slender legs**. They're usually brown or green, pale cream underneath, with a **dark stripe** from their **nose** across their **eye** to their **ear**. They have **round pads** on their **toes** to help them grip and climb.

Pacific Tree Frog breed in **shallow wetlands** with lots of plant cover that will dry up later in the season. This means they're less at risk from fish and larger frogs that need a permanent body of water. Outside of breeding season, they can be found in a wide range of habitats, often quite far from water.

Pacific Tree Frog can be found along the **Pacific coast** from southern British Columbia to Mexico and **inland** to parts of Idaho, Nevada, and western Montana.

**Could it be?** Pacific Tree Frog are often referred to as **Pacific Chorus Frog** as there are similarities. However, [Boreal Chorus Frog](/herps/borchor/) don't live in the same areas and don't have toepads.

**Did you know?** The male's breeding call is surprisingly loud for such a small animal, and it's often used as a soundtrack in movies and cartoons.
