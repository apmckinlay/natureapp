Plains Spadefoot are toads with a **round body** (1.5-2.5 in), **short legs**, a **bony lump** between the **eyes**, and a **vertical pupil**. The skin is relatively smooth and moist. They are tan to dark brown with small orange/yellow spots and a white belly. They often have **4 white stripes** down their **back**.

Plains Spadefoot can be found on **short-grass prairie** with sandy or gravelly soil for burrowing from **southern Alberta**, **Saskatchewan**, and **Manitoba** south through the **central plains** to New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Texas.

To conserve moisture, Plains Spadefoot spend much of their time buried in the sand and are **nocturnal**, coming out at night to hunt for beetles, crickets, and grasshoppers. They breed in temporary ponds after a heavy rain. The tadpoles turn into toads within 21 to 40 days, hopefully before their pond evaporates.

**Great Basin Spadefoot** look very similar but are not usually found east of British Columbia and Idaho, although they can be found occasionally in Montana. They have a low, pliable lump between the eyes, while the Plains Spadefoot's lump is high and hard.

**Did you know?** Plains Spadefoot tunnel backwards using the sharp knobs (or spades) on their hind feet. Their tunnels can extend as much as 3 ft underground.
