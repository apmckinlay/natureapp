Boreal Chorus Frog breed very early in the **spring**, even before the snow and ice melt, and you can hear them calling day and night. They prefer to lay their eggs in **small ponds** and **ditches** that will dry out as they contain less predators. During the **summer** they can be found in moist, grassy or wooded areas.

Boreal Chorus Frog are **small** (1.5 in), smooth-skinned frogs. They are gray-green to brown with **3 dark stripes** down their **back**, a **dark stripe** through their **eye**, and a **white stripe** along their **upper lip**.

The females lay their eggs in clusters, and they hatch quickly in 1-4 weeks. The tadpoles turn into frogs after about 2 months.

Boreal Chorus Frog have a **wide range** from British Columbia to Quebec and extending up into the Yukon and NWT. They are found in the central United States as far south as Arizona.

__Western Chorus Frog__ are almost identical, but their range is confined to southwestern Ontario, from Michigan to New York, and south to Tennessee. [Pacific Tree Frog](/herps/pactfrog) are often referred to as Pacific Chorus Frog as there are similarities, but they are not found in the same areas.

**Did you know?** Boreal Chorus Frog are hard to see but easy to hear. The chorus of high-pitched trills has been compared to a fingernail running along the edge of a plastic comb.
