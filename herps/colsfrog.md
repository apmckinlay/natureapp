Columbia Spotted Frog (2-4 in) can be found in the **mountainous** regions of the **Pacific Northwest**. They are light brown to olive green with dark brown spots. Their underside is pink, red, or yellow. Two **ridges** of skin run down their **head** and partway along their **back**. A **white** or **yellow stripe** runs along their **upper lip** and their **eyes** are **angled slightly upwards**.

Columbia Spotted Frog are **nocturnal** and spend most of their time in cold **mountain streams** or **marshes**. They especially like **shallow wetlands** with lots of vegetation around and in the water where they can hide. They hibernate in the mud at the bottom of lakes and ponds.

**Did you know?** Depending on the temperature of the water and the length of the summer season, the tadpoles will either turn into frogs late in the summer or overwinter as tadpoles.
