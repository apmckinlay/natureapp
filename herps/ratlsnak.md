Rattlesnake have a **thick body** with a **triangular head** and are 1-8 ft long. The scales usually form a dark geometrical pattern on a light background. They are found in **southern BC**, **AB**, and **SK** and throughout the **United States**; however, the majority live in the **deserts** of the **American southwest** and northern Mexico. Arizona has 13 species of Rattlesnake, more than any other area in North America.

It's wise to be careful where you walk, especially around **logs** or **rocky areas** where snakes may be hiding or sunning themselves, but Rattlesnake only strike when provoked and their **bite is not usually fatal**. Before striking, they hiss and rattle the rings at the end of their tail to warn off predators.

Other snakes, such as the [Bullsnake](/{{section}}/bullsnake) and the [North American Racer](/{{section}}/naracer), imitate the Rattlesnake in order to warn off predators.

**Did you know?** Rattlesnake immobilize their prey (rodents, lizards) with a toxic venom before swallowing it whole. Digesting the food makes them sluggish, so they normally hide out for a couple of days after eating.
