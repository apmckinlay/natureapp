Unlike other Salamanders, Rough-skinned Newt have **dry, bumpy skin**. They grow up to 8 in long and have a brown head and back and a **bright yellow** or **orange belly**.

Rough-skinned Newt can be found along the **Pacific coast** from Alaska to central California with small populations in **Idaho** and **Montana**. They live in **forested** areas near **ponds** and **lakes** where the larvae and young often hide in the muddy bottom. Some Rough-skinned Newt live in water year round or during the summer and can be seen swimming near the surface.

Unlike most amphibians that lay clumps of eggs, Rough-skinned Newt attach single eggs to the stems of vegetation scattered throughout their breeding area.

**Did you know?** The Rough-skinned Newts' eggs and skin are highly poisonous, and they are avoided by most predators apart from [Garter Snake](/herps/gartsnake/) that are unaffected by the poison. When threatened, Newt lift their head and tail to display their brightly-colored belly.
