Short-horned Lizards are **small** (3.5-6 in), **flat**, and **round** with a **short, pointed tail**. They have a **crown of short, pointy scales** (horns) on their head and **short, pointed scales** on their **back**. Their coloring varies from yellow to gray to reddish-brown to match their environment.

Short-horned Lizards live on the **deserts** and **semi-arid plains** of the **western United States**. They are rare in Canada and are only found at a few spots in **Alberta** and **Saskatchewan**. They hide behind rocks and burrow in sandy soil. They eat ants, grasshoppers, beetles, and spiders and are active in the **daytime**. The females keep their eggs inside their bodies and give birth to live young.

**Mountain Short-horned Lizards** are reddish with prominent horizontal spines and range from southern Utah and western Colorado through Arizona and New Mexico with rare, localized populations in southeast Alberta.

**Did you know?** Short-horned Lizards inflate their body to twice its normal size and shoot blood from their eyes to try to ward off predators.
