Bullsnakes, also known as **Gopher Snakes**, are 4-7 ft long. They have a **large head**, **large eyes**, and a **narrow neck**. They are light brown to yellow with a cream-colored belly and dark blotches on their back and sides. An enlarged nose shield helps them to burrow in the sand.

Bullsnakes are harmless to humans. They eat mainly rodents but also birds and lizards that they squeeze to death. They spend up to 90% of their time in underground dens, hibernating over winter in communal dens.

Bullsnakes prefer the loose sandy soil of **prairies**, **deserts**, and **agricultural areas** and can be found wherever **rodents** are abundant.

**Could it be?** Bullsnakes can be mistaken for [Rattlesnake](/herps/ratlsnak/) which they mimic by flattening their head and rattling their tail in bushes or leaves. [Rattlesnake](/herps/ratlsnak/) are shorter with a heavier body and vertical, cat-like eyes.

**Did you know?** Bullsnakes spend so much time in the summer sunning themselves that they can develop skin cancer.
