Tiger Salamander are **thick-bodied** amphibians with a **short snout**, **sturdy legs**, and a **long tail**. They have **yellow dots**, **stripes**, or **blotches** on a **moist dark background**. They are usually 6-8 in long but can be up to 14 in. Unlike **lizards**, salamanders don't have ear holes or claws.

Tiger Salamander are the largest land-dwelling salamander in North America and can be found in **most parts** of the **United States** and **Canada**.They eat mostly worms, insects, and spiders although adults may eat larger creatures such as small frogs or baby mice. They migrate to small ponds in late winter/early spring to lay their eggs, which they attach to underwater rocks or branches.

Tiger Salamander can be hard to spot as they are **nocturnal** and hide under **logs** or in deep **underground burrows** that protect them from extreme temperatures. This is why they're also known as **Mole Salamander**. Look for them near ponds and streams or after a heavy rain.

**Did you know?** Tiger Salamander don't need to drink. They absorb water by sitting in puddles or on dew-covered rocks.
