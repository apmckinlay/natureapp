Leafcutter Bees are about the size of a [Honey Bee](/{{section}}/honeybee) (.2-1 in) with stout, cigar-shaped **bodies**. They are black with pale-yellow stripes on their abdomen. They carry pollen on the hairs on the underside of their abdomen (not their legs) so the abdomen will look yellow when they are carrying a load.

Leafcutter Bees cut circular pieces of leaves (.25 - .5 in) and carry them to a hole to construct a nest. Their **nests** are often in rotting wood, but they can also be found in snail shells or holes in a concrete wall, in the ground, or in a plant stem. The nests contain several cells, each of which contains a lump of pollen and an egg. The adults overwinter in the nest, chewing their way out in the spring.

Leafcutters are **solitary** bees and do not live in large groups like [Bumble Bees](/{{section}}/bumbee). They are the same size as [Honey Bees](/{{section}}/honeybee) but darker, with a larger head and eyes, and a hairier belly.

**Did you know?** Leafcutter Bees are very good pollinators. One Alfalfa Leafcutter Bee can do the job of 20 [Honey Bees](/{{section}}/honeybee).
