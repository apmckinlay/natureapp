Katydid are medium- to large-sized insects with long back **legs** that are good for jumping. They are usually green with brown markings and are well camouflaged to blend in with the plants around them. Their **body** is thick and taller than it is wide. Some species have **wings** that resemble leaves.

Unlike [Grasshoppers](/insects/grasshop), Katydid have **long, thin antennae** that reach back as far as their abdomen. The adults of some species can fly. The male's front wings have special structures that can be rubbed together to make sounds.

Katydid usually eat leaves (although a few species eat insects) and can be found wherever there are lots of plants to eat. Some species are active during the day but most are **nocturnal**. Many species live in **trees**.

**Did you know?** Females are usually larger than males and have a long sharp structure at the end of their abdomen that they use to insert their eggs into the ground or plant stems.
