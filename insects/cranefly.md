Crane Flies look like giant [Mosquitoes](/insects/mosquito/), which is unfortunate, as they don't bite. They can also be mistaken for [Harvestmen](/insects/harvest/) (Daddy Long Legs) as they have very long, fragile legs that break off quite easily. Crane Flies have a narrow **body**, long narrow **wings**, and 6 legs. Different species vary greatly in color and size.

The legless, worm-like larvae are rarely seen, spending their time in moist soil, in sand along streams, or in rotting vegetation.

**Did you know?** Crane Flies only live for a few days. They mate, lay eggs for next season's flies, and then die. They may drink some dew or sugary flower nectar, but they eat next to nothing.
