Spring Azure butterflies can be spotted in **early spring** (April to mid-June). They are small butterflies (1-1.5 in wingspan). The upper surface of their **wings** is blue with a black border (much more noticeable on the females) while the under surface is gray-white with faded black dots.

Spring Azure can be found in **open woodlands**, forest edges, woody marshes, and urban gardens across most of Canada and the United States.

Spring Azure lay their eggs on the flower buds of woody shrubs and trees, such as Dogwood, Cherry, and Viburnum. The **caterpillars**, usually green, eat the flowers and developing fruit.

Spring Azure are part of a larger family of Azure butterflies, such as the Summer Azure, but are the first to appear in the spring.

**Did you know?** The caterpillars of blue butterflies are often tended by ants who provide some protection in return for eating a sweet liquid secreted by the caterpillars.
