Clouded Sulphur butterflies (1.5-2.5 inch wingspan) have light yellow **wings** with a black border on the upper side. The females' wings have yellow spots in the black border. There is also a greenish-white version. The underside usually has 2 silver spots circled in pink. They are one of the most common and widespread North American butterflies reaching their greatest numbers in **late summer** and **early fall**.

Clouded Sulphur can be found in open areas and are particularly common in fields with **alfalfa** and **clover**. The **caterpillars** are green with a dark stripe down their back and light stripes on their sides.

**Did you know?** During courtship, the males slap their wings against the female. This releases pheromones. The female responds by lowering her abdomen, and they mate.
