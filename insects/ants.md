[Ants](/insects/ants/) are small, skinny insects with a large head, a slender abdomen, and a larger thorax. They can be distinguished from other insects by their **bent antennae** and the **waist** between abdomen and thorax. They vary in size from .08-1 in long. Most are brown, but some are black, yellow, or red.

[Ants](/insects/ants/) can be found **worldwide** but are most common in hot climates. In cooler climates, ants aren't active during the winter. There are 1,000 ant species in North America. Some eat sugary liquids (for example, the "honeydew" produced by Aphids), while others eat seeds, insects, or dead meat.

[Ants](/insects/ants/) are very **social**, usually living in structured nest communities with a queen, worker ants, and males for reproduction. They release chemical signals to warn each other of danger, share food locations, and work together.

**Did you know?** [Ants](/insects/ants/) can lift and carry more than 3 times their own weight. They have two sets of jaws: an outer set for digging and carrying and an inner set for chewing.
