They may look a lot like a spider, but Harvestmen, also known as Daddy Longlegs, are not spiders. Their **body** is a simple oval without a clear differentiation between head and abdomen, and they have 2 eyes not 8.

Harvestmen don't build webs as they don't have silk glands. They don't produce venom and their mouths are too small to bite people, but they do make a weird **smell** when disturbed.

Harvestmen have **long wiggly legs** and their body is about .5 in long. They eat everything from worms and aphids to bird droppings and fungi and most species are **nocturnal**. Unlike spiders, they eat solid pieces of food rather than sipping fluids.

Every 10 days, Harvestmen shed their body casing. It takes them about 20 minutes to pull their legs out of the old casings.

**Did you know?** Harvestmen often shed a leg in order to escape a predator. However, that's a big loss as their legs are loaded with nerves and sensory organs.
