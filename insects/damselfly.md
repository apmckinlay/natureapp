Skimming low over slow-moving water, such as streams, ponds, and lakes, Damselflies are found throughout North America. They have a long thin abdomen (1-2 in), large eyes, and 2 pairs of **wings** with a wingspan of .7 to 2.5 in.

Damselflies use their spiny legs or a long hinged lower lip to capture small insects settled on grasses or in flight. At night, they perch in dense vegetation with their abdomen resting along a stem.

Damselflies are smaller with slimmer bodies than [Dragonflies](/insects/dragonfly/). They hold their **wings close together** above their body when resting, whereas [Dragonflies](/insects/dragonfly/) spread their wings apart.

Damselflies lay their eggs in the stems or leaves of aquatic plants. The nymphs live underwater, emerging as adults throughout spring, summer, and fall.

**Did you know?** Damselflies hold their prey between their legs so that they can eat while flying.
