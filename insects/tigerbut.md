Tiger Swallowtail butterflies (2.5-3.5 in wingspan) are one of North America's most familiar butterflies. They have yellow **wings** with a black border and wide black stripes. They can be found in **open woodlands** or tundra areas with stunted trees from central Alaska east across Canada and the Great Lakes to northern New England.

The mature **caterpillars** are dark green with two spots that look like eyes. They eat the leaves of [Willow](/trees/willow/), Cherry, [Balsam Poplar](/trees/balpop/), [Cottonwood](/trees/cotton/), [Aspen](/trees/aspen/), and Ash. The butterflies use their very long tongue (proboscis) to reach the nectar deep inside Wood Lily flowers, picking up **pollen** on their wings to distribute to other plants at the same time.

In different areas you will find the **Canadian**, **Eastern**, and **Western Tiger Swallowtails** as well as **Two-tailed** and **Pale Swallowtails**. They are similar in appearance and behavior with some minor differences.

**Did you know?** Tiger Swallowtails are avid mud puddlers (as are [Clouded Sulphurs](/insects/cloudsulf/)), often gathering in large groups around mud puddles and jostling each other for position. Scientists believe they are after the salt.
