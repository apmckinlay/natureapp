Tent Caterpillar form large common silk **nests** (tents) in the **forks of trees** where the moths lay their eggs in early spring. Once the caterpillars emerge, you'll often see large bands of caterpillars feeding on the tender new leaves.

Widespread outbreaks of Tent Caterpillars occur in **cities** and **forests** across North America on a cyclical basis. They're considered a pest as they can strip all the leaves off a tree.

The **caterpillars** are about two inches long and black with a white stripe or spots down their backs, a blue head, and often blue spots down their bodies. The **moths** range in color from dark red-brown to gray with two parallel lines on their forewings.

Tent Caterpillars can be confused with **Webworms**. However, Tent Caterpillars make their nests in the forks of trees where the branches connect to the trunk. Webworms form a nest that encloses the leaves and small branches at the end of a limb. They don't affect the health of the tree.

**Did you know?** 50% of what Tent Caterpillars eat is lost in fecal pellets; you'll hear the pellets falling and see them on the ground around the tree.
