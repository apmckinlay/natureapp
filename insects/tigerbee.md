If you spot a beetle moving very, very quickly across loose, sandy soil, it may well be a Tiger Beetle as they are the fastest running insect in the world. Tiger Beetles (usually ½ in long) have long, slender **legs**, large **eyes**, and strong curving **jaws**. 

Many species are brightly colored with a shiny metallic finish. The bright colors help to scare away predators, while some Tiger Beetles release deadly cyanide when threatened.

Both Tiger Beetles and their larvae are fierce hunters. The adult beetles run after their prey, grab it with their pincers, kill it, and then inject digestive fluids into the prey’s body so that they can suck out the insides. The larvae dig a burrow in soft soil and wait for their prey to walk by. When it does, they stick their head out, grab it, and eat it.

Many Tiger Beetles are most active on sunny days, while others prefer to hunt at night.

**Did you know?** Tiger Beetles run so fast they momentarily blind themselves as they don’t have time to process the images. They stop, orient themselves, and then start running again.
