Mayfly are small, soft-bodied insects with large **triangular forewings** and a long, thin body (up to 1 in) ending in 2 or 3 **hairlike tails**. They can be found near streams, rivers, pond, and lakes across North America.

Mayfly nymphs emerge from eggs and then go through two adult stages. The mature adults live only 1-2 days and spend their entire adult life in flight looking for a mate. You may see large swarms of males performing a mating dance over the surface of the water at dawn or dusk. Mayfly will die as soon as they have mated and laid eggs.

**Did you know?** Nymphs feed on algae and organic detritus and play an important role in cleaning streams. Mayfly are also a valuable food for fish, birds, spiders, and other insects.
