Water Boatmen (Corixidae) are small (less than .5 in) flat, oval, brown or gray bugs with fine markings on their back. They are found throughout North America in slow-moving **streams** and **ponds** (and birdbaths), and a few can be found in estuaries and brackish ponds near the ocean.

Water Boatmen use their short, scoop-like front **legs** to gather plant food and algae. Their four oar-shaped hind legs help them swim. Water Boatmen trap air under their shell in order to breathe underwater. They hook their legs on underwater plants and rocks to keep from floating to the surface.

**Could it be?** **Backswimmers** look very similar to Water Boatmen, but they swim upside down near the surface of the water, whereas Water Boatmen swim right side up, usually along the bottom of the pond.

**Did you know?** Water Boatmen are strong flyers and will head towards artificial lights at night, sometimes in great numbers.
