[Water Boatman](/insects/watboat/) (Corixidae) are small (less than .5 in) flat, oval, brown or gray bugs. They are found throughout North America in slow-moving **streams** and **ponds** (and birdbaths), and a few can be found in estuaries and brackish ponds near the ocean.

[Water Boatman](/insects/watboat/) can be seen **swimming right side up** along the bottom of the pond using their short, scoop-like front **legs** to gather plant food and algae. Their oar-shaped hind legs help them swim. [Water Boatman](/insects/watboat/) trap air under their shell in order to breathe underwater. They hook their legs on underwater plants and rocks to keep from floating to the surface

**Did you know?** [Water Boatman](/insects/watboat/) fly to artificial lights at night, sometimes in great numbers.
