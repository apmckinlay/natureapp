Mason Bees are **small** stingless bees (.2-.8 in long) with round, wide heads and abdomens. Most are a **metallic** blue, green, or even purple. There are over 139 species native to North America. They are most commonly found in the **west** with greater species diversity in mountainous areas. They're less common in the north and in deserts.

Mason Bees are most commonly seen in **spring** and play an important role in pollination of spring-flowering trees and shrubs, including apples, cherries, blueberries, and raspberries. The females carry the pollen in a patch of hair on the underside of their abdomens.

Mason Bees are **solitary** and nest in crevices (hollow plant stems, empty snail shells, between stones) using mud to build their nests. They readily occupy artificial nest sites.

**Did you know?** Mason Bees spend most of their lives in their nests so protecting the nests from disturbance is important.
