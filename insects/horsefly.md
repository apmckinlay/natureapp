Horse Flies are **larger** than [House Flies](/insects/housefly/) (up to 1 in long) and dark-colored with clear **wings**. They have very large eyes that extend sideways. The females have a nasty bite.

Horse Flies are most abundant during the **summer** and only fly during the day. They breed in moist areas.

**Could it be?** **Deer Flies**, a species of Horse Fly, are smaller (.4 in long) and narrower with dark patches on their clear wings.

**Did you know?** Horse Flies can be traced back to the Late Jurassic period in China, 145-160 million years ago.
