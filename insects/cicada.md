Cicadas are large insects (1-2 in) with **big eyes** in a **broad head** with short antennae and 4 **clear, veined wings**.You have probably heard them as the males make a loud noise to attract females, usually by vibrating a pair of structures behind the wings that resemble small drums. The noise resembles the buzz of overhead power lines and is so loud it can be heard at a distance of 1½ miles.

Cicadas are found in **grasslands** and **forests** across the United States and southern Canada as well as in Alaska and the Northwest Territories. They spend most of their lives as **juvenile** nymphs in underground burrows where they suck nectar from plant roots. The **adults** come above ground from July to September but only live for about a month, long enough to mate and lay eggs. **Annual cicada**, the only kind found in Canada, appear every year. **Periodical cicada** time their adult emergence to appear all at once every 13 or 17 years. 

**Did you know?** Unlike Grasshoppers and Crickets, Cicadas are not able to hop. They usually fly as they don’t run or walk well.
