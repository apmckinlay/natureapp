A common sight across Canada and the northern United States in **summer** and in the southern United States and along the west coast **year-round**, Killdeer can often be found at the water's edge but also on open ground with little or no vegetation (lawns, golf courses, roads, beaches).

Killdeer (8-11 in) have a **large round head** with **large eyes** and a short beak. They have a **long**, **pointed tail** and **long wings** (18 in wingspan). They are brown on top and white below with two **black bands** across their **chest** and **black** and **white patches** on their **face**. A bright **orange patch** on their **rump** is visible when flying.

Killdeer eat mostly **insects** and will follow a farmer's plow in search of worms.  Their nest is a shallow depression scratched into the bare ground (often a gravel road). They lead predators away from their nest by pretending to have a **broken wing**.

**Could it be?** **Juvenile** Killdeer with only one black breast band can be confused with **Wilson's** or **Semipalmated Plovers.**

**Did you know?** In very hot climates adult Killdeer shade their eggs at midday and may soak their belly feathers to help cool the eggs.
