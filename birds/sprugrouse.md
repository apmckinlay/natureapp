Spruce Grouse live in the **coniferous forests** of Canada and the northern United States where they eat the needles and buds of [Spruce](/trees/spruce) and other coniferous trees.

They are **dark**, **thick-bodied** birds (15 in) with bold white lines on the chest and belly, a **red comb** above the eyes, and a **white semi-circle** below it.

[Ruffed Grouse](/birds/rufgrouse) have a pale tail with a dark band near the tip and prefer deciduous forests. [Blue Grouse](/birds/blugrouse) (__Dusky Grouse__ found in the Rockies, and __Sooty Grouse__ found on west coast) are both larger.

**Did you know?** Spruce Grouse can store up to 10% of their body weight in food in their crop to digest overnight.
