Prairie Falcon can be seen **flying low** over western **deserts** and **grasslands** from southern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba south to California, Arizona, and New Mexico. They nest on ledges or crevices of cliffs and avoid forested areas and coasts.

Prairie Falcon are **large** (15-18 in, 35-45 in wingspan) with a **light-brown upper body** and a **cream-colored chest streaked with brown**. There are **brown vertical streaks below their eyes** and **dark-colored patches** at the **base of each wing** on the underside.

In summer, Prairie Falcon catch small animals, such as [Richardson's Ground Squirrels](/animals/richgs/), but in winter they prey on small birds, such as **Horned Lark** and [Western Meadowlark](/birds/westmlark/).

**Could it be?** [Peregrine Falcon](/birds/peregrine/) are a similar size but darker and don't have dark patches under their wings. [Kestrel](/birds/kestrel/) and [Merlin](/birds/merlin/) are both much smaller.

**Did you know?** During courtship, the male and female spend a month or more visiting potential nest sites together.
