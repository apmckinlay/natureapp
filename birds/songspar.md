Song Sparrows are chubby, medium-sized (4.5-7 in) **streaky-brown** birds with a paler breast with bold brown streaks. They have a **dark streak** on **either side of their beak** and often have a **dark patch** in the **centre of their breast**.

Song Sparrows are common across North America, but their **appearance can vary** greatly from one area to another. Pacific Northwest Song Sparrows are dark and heavily streaked, while Song Sparrows in the Southwest desert region are pale.

Song Sparrows spend their **summers** across Canada and the north-central United States, migrating to the southern United States in **winter**. They can be found **year-round** in the western United States and south and east of the Great Lakes.

Song Sparrows make **short, fluttering flights** pumping their **tail up and down**. They prefer areas with low shrubs and bushes.

[House Sparrow](/birds/houspar/), introduced to North America in 1851, are chunkier (6-6.7 in long) with a shorter tail and stouter beak.

**Did you know?** Song Sparrows often two lay two or more clutches of eggs per season.
