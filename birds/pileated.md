Pileated Woodpecker are one of the largest North American woodpeckers. The size of an [Crow](/birds/crow) (18 in), they have a **triangular red crest** on top of their head and a **long neck**. They have a black body with **white markings** on the **head** and **neck**. Their chisel-like **bill** is almost as long as their head. **Males** have a red stripe on their cheek.

Pileated Woodpecker can be found **year-round** in the **forested** areas of northern and eastern Canada, and the west coast and eastern United States. They dig **rectangular holes** in dead wood and standing trees looking for Carpenter [Ants](/insects/ants) and other insects.

**Did you know?** Pileated Woodpecker usually mate for life and share nesting duties (building, incubating, feeding).
