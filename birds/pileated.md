Pileated Woodpeckers are one of the largest North American woodpeckers. The size of a [Crow](/birds/crow/) (16-19 in), they have a **triangular red crest** on top of their head and a **long neck**. They have a black body with **white markings** on the **head** and **neck**. Their chisel-like **bill** is almost as long as their head. **Males** have a red stripe on their cheek.

Pileated Woodpeckers can be found **year-round** in the **forested** areas of northern and eastern Canada as well as the west coast and eastern United States. They are sometimes seen in **cities** in wooded areas with dead trees. They dig **rectangular holes** in dead wood and standing trees looking for Carpenter [Ants](/insects/ants/) and other insects.

**Did you know?** Pileated Woodpeckers usually mate for life and share nesting duties (excavating a cavity in a dead tree, sitting on the eggs, and feeding the nestlings).
