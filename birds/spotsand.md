Most sandpipers nest in the far north, but Spotted Sandpiper are common near rivers, lakes, and streams and coastlines across North America in **summer**. Some **winter** along the Pacific coast and the southern United States, while others head even further south.

A medium-sized (7.5 in) shorebird, Spotted Sandpiper **bob their tails up and down** while walking.

The Spotted Sandpiper's bill is almost as long as its head and its body tapers to a longish tail. In **summer**, they have a dark-brown back, a white belly with dark spots, and a bright orange bill. The colors are more muted in **winter** with a light brown back, no spots on the belly, and a pale yellow bill. You can spot a **white stripe** on their **wings** when they are **flying**.

**Did you know?** Female Spotted Sandpipers mate with up to 5 males, leaving the males to incubate the eggs and feed the young.
