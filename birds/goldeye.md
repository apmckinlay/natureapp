Common Goldeneyes are a medium-sized duck (16-20 in) with a **bright yellow eye** and a **large puffy head**. **Males** have a black back and white sides. Their glossy green head often appears black, and there is a large white spot near the bill and below the eye. **Females** have a brown head and gray back and wings. Both males and females display a **large white patch** on their **wings** when **flying** and their wings make a **whistling sound** as they fly.

Goldeneyes spend their **summers** in Canada and Alaska's **boreal forest** where they nest in **tree cavities** near wetlands, lakes, and rivers. They migrate south in **winter** to open waters, along the **coast** or near large inland lakes and rivers, in southern Canada and across the United States. They gather in flocks, often **diving** simultaneously for food. Some birds can be found **year-round** in the Pacific Northwest, around the Great Lakes, and in the Maritimes.

**Barrow's Goldeneye** spend their summers in Alaska and down through British Columbia to southern Alberta. They have a shorter bill and a nearly vertical forehead. 

**Could it be?** **Buffleheads** are smaller than Goldeneyes. The white patch on the male **Bufflehead** is around the neck and behind the eye rather than near the bill. Female **Buffleheads** have a white patch on their head; female Goldeneyes don't.

**Did you know?** Goldeneye chicks leave the nest the day after they hatch. And the first step can be a tricky one as the nest may be 40 ft up a tree. They start feeding themselves immediately.
