Golden Eagles soar or glide with **wings lifted in a slight V** and **wingtip feathers spread out like fingers** over open, undeveloped **grasslands** near **mountains, hills**, and **cliffs**. These large birds (26-38 in) have a **wingspan of 6-7 ft**. The **adults** are dark brown with golden-brown feathers on the back of their head and neck. The **young** have white patches under their wings and at the base of the tail.

Golden Eagles **usually nest on cliffs** but may nest in trees or on tall human-made structures. They **hunt mostly small animals** (rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, prairie dogs). They can be found **year-round** in western North America's mountainous regions. Migrating birds spend the **summer** in northern Canada and Alaska, heading to the midwestern United States from North Dakota to Texas in **winter**.

**Could it be?** [Bald Eagles](/birds/baldeagle/) have a larger head and soar with wings flat like a board. [Turkey Vultures](/birds/turkvult/) have a much smaller head and hold their wings in a pronounced V-shape.

**Did you know?** The Golden Eagles' territorial/courtship display is known as sky dancing and consists of a series of steep dives and upward swoops.
