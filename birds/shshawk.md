Sharp-shinned Hawk (Sharpie) are the **smallest North American hawk** (9-14 in) with a **small head**, **short wings**, **long legs**, and **long tail**. They can be hard to spot as they hide in bushes and wooded areas, ready to leap out and pounce on passing songbirds. However, they can often be seen in large numbers during migration.

Sharp-shinned Hawk have a **dark gray back** and **head** and a **white breast with reddish-orange streaks**. Juveniles have a **brown back** and **head**. There are **broad dark bands** across their **tail**.

Sharp-shinned Hawk can be found **year-round** along the Pacific coast from Alaska to California, in the **forested** areas of the US Midwest, around the Great Lakes, and the northeastern United States. Others spend their **summers** in the dense, coniferous forests of Alaska, Canada and the northern plains of the United States, heading south to spend their **winters** in the United States.

**Could it be?** **Cooper's Hawk** are more common in urban areas and have a larger head that extends well beyond the bend in their wings when in flight. **[Merlin](/birds/merlin/)** have pointed wings, a shorter tail, and usually hunt in the open.

**Did you know?** Small birds make up 90% of the Sharp-shinned Hawk's diet and are plucked before eating.
