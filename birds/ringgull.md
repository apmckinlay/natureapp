Ring-billed Gull are the **most common inland gull**. They're very comfortable around people and are frequently found in parking lots or **scavenging for food** at landfills.

Gulls are long-winged, white birds with gray and black markings. It can be difficult to tell them apart as they take **up to 4 years to develop their adult plumage**. In addition, gulls often mate with each other, so there are **hybrids** with characteristics of two species.

Ring-billed Gull are a **medium-sized** bird (17-21 in) with a **black ring** around the tip of their bill. They spend their **summers** in Canada and the northern United States. **Winters** are spent around the Great Lakes and in the southern United States as well as along its coasts.

**Could it be?** [Herring Gull](/birds/herrgull/) are larger and have thicker bills without the black ring. [California Gull](/birds/calgull/) are slightly larger and have a red spot as well as a black band on their bill.

**Did you know?** Nesting colonies of Ring-billed Gull normally include a few two-female couples, both of whom lay a clutch of eggs.
