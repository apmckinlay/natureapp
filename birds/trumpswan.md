Trumpeter Swans are **white** with a **long straight neck**, straight **black beak**, and **black legs** (young birds are gray). They're North America's largest native waterfowl (4.5-5 ft) with a wingspan of up to 10 ft, weighing more than 25 lbs.

Trumpeter Swans can be found in three different areas: the **Pacific coast** from Alaska to Oregon; the **Rocky Mountains** of British Columbia and Alberta, and an **interior** population in South Dakota, Idaho, Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Northern birds move south to ice-free waters in the **winter**, either along the Pacific coast or in the interior of the United States. Scattered populations can be found **year-round** in all three areas.

Trumpeter Swans breed in open areas near shallow water (estuaries, lakes, rivers) and nest on small islands or on top of [Beaver](/animals/beaver/) or [Muskrat](/animals/muskrat/) dams. They forage for **aquatic vegetation** in shallow water or **leftover grain** in fields. They loosen underwater roots by pumping their feet up and down to create water currents.

**Could it be?** **Tundra Swans** are half the size of Trumpeter Swans and have a high whistling call. **Mute Swans** have a curved neck and a black knob at the top of their orange bill. [Snow Goose](/birds/snogoose/) are smaller with shorter necks, a pink bill, and black wingtips.

**Did you know?** Trumpeter Swans incubate their eggs by covering them with their webbed feet.
