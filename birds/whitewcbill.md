White-winged Crossbills have a **thick curved bill** with **crossed tips** that they use to extract seeds from evergreen cones. They are a small (5-6.5 in) plump bird that can be found **year-round** in in the **boreal forests** of Canada and Alaska and in the northern United States in **winter**. The birds move in flocks, **travelling large distances** in search of food.

**Male** White-winged Crossbills have a pinkish-red body with black wings and tail and two large white wingbars. The **females** have yellowish-green bodies with dark brown wings and tail and two large white wingbars. As long as there is a good supply of conifer seeds, Crossbills can breed at any time of year as their young are fed regurgitated conifer seeds.

**Could it be?** [Red Crossbills](/birds/redcross/) do not have white wingbars, and the males are darker red. [Pine Siskins](/birds/pinesisk/) resemble juvenile Crossbill but have a straight, thinner bill and yellow in their wings. [Pine Grosbeaks](/birds/pinegros/) are larger with a stubbier bill and longer tail.

**Did you know?** Individual White-winged Crossbills can eat up to 3,000 conifer seeds each day.
