Mallards are large stout birds (20-26 in) and the most abundant, wide-ranging duck on earth. **Male** Mallards have a shiny green head and a bright yellow beak along with a gray body, a brown breast, and a black rear. **Females** are mottled brown with an orange-and-brown bill. Both males and females have bright orange legs and feet.

Mallards prefer **grassy areas around ponds and marshes** but can also be found on lakes, rivers, and in cities.

They can be found **year-round** in the United States and coastal British Columbia. In the **summer**, they can be found in Alaska and Canada (especially the Prairie provinces; they're less common in the Maritimes). In **winter** they migrate to the east coast and Gulf area of the United States.

Mallards feed by tipping forward and grazing on **underwater plants** (dabbling). They also eat **grasses** and **grains** on land. During breeding season, they eat mainly **animal matter** (worms, snails, larvae).

**Did you know?** A Mallard's nest site may be over a mile from water. Once the ducklings hatch, the hen will lead them to water.
