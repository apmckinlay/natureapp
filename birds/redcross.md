Red Crossbill have a **thick curved bill** with **crossed tips** that they use to extract seeds from conifer cones. They are a small (5-6.5 in) plump bird and can be found **year-round** in in the **boreal forests** of the north, the west coast, and the western mountainous areas and throughout the United States in **winter**. The birds move in flocks and don't have a set migration but do **travel large distances** in search of **food**.

**Males** have a red body and blackish-brown wings and tail. **Females** are gray with an an olive-green chest and rump and blackish-brown wings and tail.

[White-winged Crossbill](/birds/whitewcbill/) have black wings and white wingbars; the males are a lighter red. [Pine Siskin](/birds/pinesisk/) resemble juvenile Crossbill but have a straight, thinner bill and yellow in their wings. [Pine Grosbeak](/birds/pinegros/) are larger with a stubbier bill and longer tail.

**Did you know?** As long as there is a good supply of conifer seeds, Red Crossbill can breed at any time of year as their young are fed regurgitated conifer seeds.
