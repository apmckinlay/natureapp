Buffleheads are small (13-16 in) ducks with a large, rounded head. **Males** have a black and white body, a dark green and purple head, and a large white patch behind their eyes and around the back of their head. **Females** and **first-year males** are gray-brown with a smaller white patch behind their eye.

Buffleheads spend their **summers** in Canada’s northern boreal forest and Alaska where they lay 4-17 eggs in existing holes in Aspens and Poplars (and Pines in California) that are close to water. They prefer smaller holes excavated by Northern Flickers as there is less competition for the nesting space from the larger Goldeneyes. Buffleheads spend their **winters** along the east and west coasts, around the Great Lakes, and throughout the southern United States.

Buffleheads are seldom seen on dry land. Even the goslings only spend 1-2 days in the nest before following their mother as she jumps to the ground and leads them to water.

Unlike most ducks, Buffleheads return to the same mate and to the same nest year after year. 

**Could it be?** Goldeneyes are larger than Buffleheads. The males have a small white patch beside their beak rather than behind the eye and around the back of the head. Female Goldeneyes don’t have a white patch on their head.

**Did you know?** Buffleheads are very active, spending almost a quarter of their time diving for food.
