Glaucous-winged Gulls are **large** birds (20-23 in, 47-56 in wingspan) found year-round on the **north Pacific coast**. They rarely head inland. Some spend the **summer** along the coast of Alaska and northern British Columbia, heading to Oregon and California for the **winter**. Others remain **year-round** along the west coast from Alaska to Washington.

Gulls are long-winged, white birds with gray and black markings. It can be difficult to tell them apart as they take **up to 4 years to develop their adult plumage**. In addition, gulls often mate with each other, so there are **hybrids** with characteristics of two species.

Glaucous-winged Gulls have **wing tips** that are only slightly darker than their gray back. They have **pink legs** and a **red spot** on a **yellow beak**.

**Could it be?** **Western Gulls** have a darker back and wing tips and can be found from southern British Columbia to Baja. They hybridize with Glaucous-winged Gull in the northern end of their range so there are many intermediates.

**Did you know?** Glaucous-winged Gulls eat a variety of food, including live Pigeons and Rabbits.
