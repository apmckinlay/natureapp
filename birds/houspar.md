House Sparrow are one of our most common urban birds. Introduced from Europe in 1851, they are not related to other North American sparrows. They are **chunkier** with a **larger rounded head**, a **shorter tail**, and a **stouter bill** than other sparrows.

**Males** have a gray head, white cheeks, a black throat, and a rusty-colored back. **Females** have a striped light brown back and gray underparts.

House Sparrow can be found on **farms**, **city streets** and **parks** throughout **southern Canada** and the **United States**. They won't be found in undisturbed forests and grasslands.

House Sparrow eat mostly **seeds** but also some **insects** and are very adaptable, taking advantage of smashed insects on parked cars, crumbs on restaurant patios, and bird feeders.

**Did you know?** House Sparrow like to take dust baths, throwing dust and dirt over their feathers as if it was water.
