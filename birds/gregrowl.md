Great Gray Owls can be found **year-round** in the **evergreen forests** of Alaska and northern Canada as well as the **western mountain region** stretching from British Columbia through Washington, Idaho, Montana, and parts of California.

Great Gray Owls are the **tallest** (24-33 in) North American owl with the **largest wingspan** (4.5-5 ft) but are mostly fluff and **only half the weight** of a [Snowy Owl](/birds/snowyowl/) or [Great Horned Owl](/birds/grehowl/).

They have **silvery gray** feathers, a round head with a **large facial disc**, a **black and white bowtie** across the neck, and **yellow** eyes and beak.

Great Gray Owls hunt for rodents and other small mammals during the **day**. They prefer a mix of **dense forest** for nesting and roosting and **open areas** (meadows, clearings) for hunting.

**Could it be?** [Great Horned Owl](/birds/grehowl/) hunt at night and have earlike tufts on their head. [Northern Hawk Owl](/birds/norhowl/) are also found in northern boreal forests, but they have a long tail and short pointed wings. **Barred Owls** are smaller with dark eyes and no black-and-white throat markings.

**Did you know?** Great Gray Owls have very good hearing and can detect prey under 2 ft of snow thanks to the facial disc feathers that channel sound to the ears.
