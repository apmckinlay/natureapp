Double-crested Cormorants are large (28-35 in) **black waterbirds** with a **long crooked neck** and a thin hooked beak. The crest isn't noticeable. Their heavy bodies sit very low in the water and they **dive** to catch small fish.

A very adaptable bird, Double-crested Cormorants can be found on **inland lakes and rivers** as well as **along the coast**. They spend the **summer** in west-central Canada and the United States, along the St. Lawrence River, and on the coast of Canada's Maritime provinces. They **winter** in the southeastern United States and along the Gulf coast. They can be found **year-round** along the Pacific coast and in Florida, nesting in colonies on cliffs, islands, or in trees.

Double-crested Cormorants are often seen sitting on a perch with their **wings spread out to dry**. They have **less preen oil** than other birds so their feathers get waterlogged and need to be dried out.

**Could it be?** Six types of Cormorants are native to North America. **Double-crested Cormorants** are the most abundant and widespread. **Great Cormorants** are found along the Atlantic coast. **Pelagic Cormorants** and **Brandt's Cormorants** are found along the Pacific coast. **Neotropic Cormorants** and **Anhingas** are only found in the southern United States.

**Did you know?** Cormorants can dive and move around underwater easily because the lack of preen oil in their feathers means they are less buoyant.
