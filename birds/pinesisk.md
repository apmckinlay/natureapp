Pine Siskins are **small** (4-5.5 in), **streaky-brown** birds with **yellow edging** on their **wings** and **tail**. They have a **sharp, pointed beak** and a **short, notched tail**.

Pine Siskins can be found **year-round** in southern Canada and the western United States as well as in northern Canada in the **summer** and the whole of the United States in **winter**.

Pine Siskins nest in the **forest** coming out to fields, shrubby areas, and urban parks and gardens to forage for **seeds**. They congregate in **large flocks**, calling to each other as they eat. You'll often see them clinging **upside down** to branch tips to eat seeds in cones.

**Could it be?** Pine Siskins are smaller than **Sparrows**. Their yellow markings and streaked breast distinguish them from other **Finches** and **Redpolls**.

**Did you know?** Pine Siskins survive cold winter nights by increasing their metabolism to 5 times its normal rate.
