American Robins are a medium-sized bird (8-11 in) with a gray-brown back, **black head**, **red breast**, **white patch** on lower belly, bright **yellow beak**. The female colors are less bold. Robins can be found throughout Canada and the United States, primarily in **urban areas**, but they can also be found in mountain forests and the Alaska wilderness. Many northern birds migrate south for the **winter** but some remain **year-round**. You're less likely to spot Robins in **winter** when they spend more time in trees than on the ground.

Robins are one of the **first birds** to **sing** in the **morning** and will still be singing **late at night**, especially during breeding season. You can spot them looking for **worms and insects** in the grass, usually in the morning, as they prefer **fruit** in the afternoon. They form **large flocks in winter** and can often be seen in treetops or around trees with berries.

**Did you know?** The American Robin is the largest thrush in North America and is not related to the European Robin, which is much smaller.
