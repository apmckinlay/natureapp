Black-capped Chickadee are lively little birds (4-6 in) with a **large round head**. **Gray** on top and **white** or **light orange/brown** underneath, they have a **black cap and chin** and **white cheeks**. The **wings** have **white edges**. Listen for their **call** (chick-a-dee-dee-dee).

Black-capped Chickadee are very acrobatic and can often be seen clinging upside down to a tree trunk. They eat insects, seeds, and berries and can often be found at **bird feeders**, especially in **winter**. They hide seeds and other food items to eat later. Each item is placed in a different spot and the chickadee can remember thousands of hiding places.

Black-capped Chickadee can be found **year-round** in **Canada** and the **northern United States**.

**Mountain Chickadee** are found in western mountain forests and have a white stripe over their eyes. **Brown-capped Boreal Chickadee** are found in Canada's northern boreal forests and have a brown cap and back. **Carolina Chickadee** are found in the southeastern United States and have less white edging on their wings and a longer song.

**Did you know?** Each chickadee sleeps in its own individual hole in rotten tree trunks or stumps.
