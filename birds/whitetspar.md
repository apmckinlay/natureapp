White-throated Sparrows (6-7 in long) are brown above and gray below with a **black-and-white striped head** (sometimes tan with a dark brown stripe), a **white throat**, and **yellow patches** between the eyes and the bill.

Flocks of White-throated Sparrows can be seen on the ground looking for seeds and berries, often coming to bird feeders near wooded areas. They spend their **summers** in forests across northern Canada and Alaska as well as the mountainous area stretching from British Columbia and Alberta to Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. **Winters** are spent in the southern United States and Mexico.

**Could it be?** [White-crowned Sparrows](/birds/whitecspar/) have a gray throat and breast and no yellow patch. [House Sparrows](/birds/houspar/), introduced to North America in 1851, are chunkier (6-6.7 in long) with a shorter tail and stouter beak.

**Did you know?** Males prefer females with white stripes, and females prefer males with brown stripes.
