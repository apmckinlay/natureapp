White-throated Sparrow (6.5 in long) are brown above and gray below with a **black-and-white striped head** (sometimes tan with a dark brown stripe), a **white throat**, and a **yellow patch** between the eye and the bill.

Flocks of White-throated Sparrow can be seen on the ground looking for seeds and berries, often coming to bird feeders near wooded areas. They spend their **summers** in forests across northern Canada and Alaska as well as the mountainous area stretching from British Columbia and Alberta to Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. **Winters** are spent in the southern United States and Mexico.

[White-crowned Sparrow](/birds/whitecspar) have a gray throat and breast and no yellow patch. [House Sparrow](/birds/houspar), introduced to North America in 1851, are chunkier with a shorter tail and stouter beak (5.9-6.7 in long).

**Did you know?** Males prefer females with white stripes, and females prefer males with brown stripes.
