White-throated Sparrow (6 1/2 in long) are brown above and gray below with a **black-and-white striped head** (sometimes tan with a dark brown stripe), a **white throat**, and a **yellow patch** between the eye and the bill.

Flocks of White-throated Sparrows can be seen on the ground looking for seeds and berries, often coming to bird feeders near wooded areas. They spend their **summers** in forests across Canada, the northeastern United States, and the northern Midwest. **Winters** are spent in the southeastern United States.

[White-crowned Sparrow](/{{section}}/whitecspar) have a gray throat and breast and no yellow patch. [House Sparrow](/{{section}}/houspar), introduced to North America in 1851, are chunkier with a shorter tail and stouter beak (5.9-6.7 in long).

**Did you know?** Males prefer females with white stripes, and females prefer males with brown stripes.
