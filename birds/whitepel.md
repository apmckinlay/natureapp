The White Pelican is one of North America's largest birds. Their **black and white wings** have a 9-ft span and flocks often soar very high in the sky, circling and wheeling. They dip their **pouched orange bills** in the water to scoop up water and fish, draining the water out of their bills before tilting their heads back to swallow. They lay 1-6 eggs on a shallow mound on an island in a lake or wetland.

Pelicans spend their **summers** on the **lakes and rivers** of the Canadian Prairies south to Montana and North Dakota. **Winters** are spent along the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific **coast**, but they can sometimes be found inland in California and there is a **non-migratory** population in Texas.

The birds return to the same sites year after year. The second largest colony in Canada is found on Lavallee Lake, **Prince Albert National Park**.

White Pelicans and [Double-crested Cormorants](/birds/doubcorm/) are often found together. 

**Could it be?** **Brown Pelicans** have dark feathers, dive for their food, and are much smaller than White Pelicans.

**Did you know?** Pelicans sometimes fish cooperatively, coordinating their swimming to drive corralled fish towards shallow water.
