Look for Red-tailed Hawk **soaring in circles** over open fields or **perched** on poles and fence posts. They're found across Canada in the **summer** and **year-round** in the United States and are the most commonly seen hawk in North America.

A **large** bird (18-26 in, wingspan of 45-52 in) with a **rusty-red tail**, Red-tailed Hawk are usually a rich brown color above and pale below with a pale face, but this can vary with some birds much darker than others. They have **broad rounded wings** and a **short wide tail**. A **dark bar** at the **edge of their wings** is visible in **flight**.

Red-tailed Hawk build **bulky stick nests**, usually in a tree or on a cliff ledge. Their diet consists of small mammals, birds, and snakes.

**Red-shouldered Hawk** are smaller with warm red markings on the breast. [Swainson's Hawk](/birds/swahawk/) have a dark chest and dark edges to their wings. [Turkey Vulture](/birds/turkvult/) can look similar from a distance but have longer, more rectangular wings, which they hold above the horizontal to form a V. They are less steady when soaring.

**Did you know?** Birds are amazingly adapted for life in the air. Red-tailed Hawk are one of the largest North American birds, but they weigh at most 3 pounds. Dogs of a similar size weigh 10 times as much.
