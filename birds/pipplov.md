With a **sandy gray back** and **head**, tiny Piping Plovers (6.5-7.5 in) are almost invisible until they run along the beach, stop, and tilt their head to pick an insect or worm from the sand. They have a **white belly**, **yellowish-orange legs**, and **large black eyes**. During the **summer** breeding season, they sport a black collar, a black line across their forehead, and a black tip on their short, orange beak. In **winter**, the bill is black and collar is broken and fades to gray.

Piping Plovers **breed** in two different regions: along the **coast in the northeast** and around **lakes and rivers** on the **northern plains** and around the **Great Lakes**. They migrate to the **Gulf Coast** and the **south Atlantic coast** or the Caribbean in **winter**.

Piping Plovers are an endangered species in both Canada and the United States.

**Could it be?** [Killdeer](/birds/killdeer/) are larger than Piping Plovers with a darker back, two black bands on their chest, and a longer bill. [Sanderling](/birds/sander/) have bills as long as their head or longer.

**Did you know?** Intruders near a Piping Plover's nest may be chased or bitten. One [Killdeer](/birds/killdeer/) was observed limping for an entire summer after getting too close to a nest.
