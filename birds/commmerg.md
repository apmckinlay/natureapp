**Male** Common Merganser have gray bodies with white bellies (21-28 in) and a dark green head. The **females** are equally colorful with a gray body, rusty-red head and crest, and a white chin and chest. Both males and females have a slender, red bill.

Merganser spend the **summer** breeding season on the **lakes** and **rivers** of the northern forests of Canada and Alaska. They **winter** on the lakes and rivers of northern and western United States. Merganser can also be found year-round along the coast of BC, in the northwestern United States, and in the Maritimes and along the St. Lawrence.  They prefer **freshwater** but can sometimes be found in harbors and estuaries in **winter**. They're often found in **large flocks**.

The birds often **nest** in hollow trees or cavities up to 100 feet off the ground and within a mile of water. An excellent diver, they feed primarily on small **fish**, but they also eat insects and other small aquatic creatures.

**Red-breasted Merganser** are smaller and prefer salt water; the males have reddish markings on their chest. **Hooded Merganser** are much smaller, although the fan-shaped crest makes their heads look very large.

**Did you know?** Common Merganser have serrated edges to their beaks that help them to hold onto fish.
