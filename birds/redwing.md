Red-winged Blackbird (7-9 in) are one of the most abundant birds in North America. They can be found in **[Cattail](/plants/cattail) marshes**, **wet meadows**, and **ditches** in Canada and the northern United States in the **summer** and all **year round** in the rest of the United States.

**Males** are glossy black with **red and yellow shoulder patches**. **Females** are streaky-brown with a **white stripe over the eye** and an **orange patch** on the **upper chest**. They eat **insects** in summer and **seeds** in winter.

Males perch on high stalks or telephone wires, singing to defend their territory and attract mates. They spend up to 1/4 of daylight hours chasing away rivals and predators, including animals much larger than themselves. Nests are placed low among marsh vegetation.

Male **Tricolored Blackbird** (California) have shinier feathers and shoulder patches outlined in white.

**Did you know?** Male Red-winged Blackbird have up to 15 mates.
