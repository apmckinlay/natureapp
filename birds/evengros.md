Evening Grosbeak flock to **bird feeders** and **trees with berries** in winter. **Males** are yellow and black with a large white patch on their wings. **Females** and **young birds** are light gray with a yellow collar and small white patches on their wings and tail. They're **chunky** birds (6.5-8.5 in).

Evening Grosbeak eat **insect larvae** in the summer and **seeds**, **buds**, **berries**, and **small fruit** in winter.

Evening Grosbeak can be found **year-round** in British Columbia, northern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, eastern Canada, and the western mountainous areas of the United States. In **winter**, they can be found in the southern Prairies and most parts of the United States. Large flocks occasionally travel south in **winter** looking for food.

**American Goldfinch** are much smaller with smaller, darker bills. Female and immature male [Pine Grosbeak](/birds/pinegros) have shorter, darker bills and lack the boldly patterned wings.

**Did you know?** Evening Grosbeak's thick, cone-shaped beak is very strong and can crush large seeds, such as cherries and olives.
