Long-eared Owl are slender owls (13-16 in) with **long ear tufts** pointing straight up. Their **dark mottled feathers** and **rusty-orange facial disc** provide excellent camouflage when **roosting** during the **day** in **thick stands of trees**.

They hunt in **open grasslands** at **night**, occasionally at dusk, **flying low over the ground** and searching for prey by sight or sound. They eat small mammals, particularly **rodents**.

Long-eared Owls don't build their own nests. Instead, they use stick nests built by [Crow](/{{section}}/crow) and [Black-billed Magpie](/{{section}}/blbmagpie).

[Great Horned Owl](/{{section}}/grehowl) are larger than Long-eared Owls. Their ear tufts are shorter and point out at an angle rather than straight up and down.

**Did you know?** If disturbed on their nest, Long-eared Owl raise their ear tufts and compress their feathers to disguise themselves as a broken branch.
