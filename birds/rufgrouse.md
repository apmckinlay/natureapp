[Ruffed Grouse](/birds/rufgrouse/) are **small** **chicken-like** birds (17 in) with a short **triangular crest** and a wide, **fan-like tail**. They have short legs and often look slimmer than other grouse. They are reddish-brown to black with white markings with a wide black band near the tip of their tail. Males have a ruff of black neck feathers that stand out straight and surround their head like an umbrella when displaying before a female.

[Ruffed Grouse](/birds/rufgrouse/) can often be heard before they are seen as they are very good at camouflaging themselves. The **males** stand on a log and beat the air with their wings to make a **deep drumming sound** in spring and sometimes in fall to show where their territory is and attract females.

[Ruffed Grouse](/birds/rufgrouse/) can be found in **deciduous forests** across Canada and in the western and eastern mountain regions and around the Great Lakes of the USA.

[Spruce Grouse](/birds/sprugrouse/) are slightly smaller and darker with a short black tail. [Blue Grouse](/birds/blugrouse/) are larger.  **Ring-necked Pheasant** are found in more open areas and have a long, thin, pointed tail.

**Did you know?** [Ruffed Grouse](/birds/rufgrouse/) are well adapted for cold winters. They nestle in the snow to keep warm and scales on their toes can spread out and act like snowshoes.
