With a **loud voice**, a **long tail**, **black** head and back, **white** wing patches and underparts, [Magpie](/birds/magpie/) are easy to spot. These **large** birds (1.5-2 ft) are frequently found in **groups** as they are **very social**. You'll often find them **on the ground** in urban **parks** foraging for food (insects, wild fruit, grain, small animals, carrion).

[Magpie](/birds/magpie/) live **year-round** in **northwestern Canada** and the **United State**s. You won't find them along the west coast, but you will find them in the interior of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.

Black-billed (American) [Magpie](/birds/magpie/) are almost identical to the **Eurasian [Magpie](/birds/magpie/)**, one of the world's most intelligent animals. **Yellow-billed [Magpie](/birds/magpie/)** are only found in California's central valleys and have a yellow beak.

**Did you know?** [Magpie](/birds/magpie/) build large domed nests to protect eggs and young from the weather. They are so well constructed they can last for many years.
