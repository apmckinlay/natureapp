These feisty little birds (2.8-3.5 in) will defend their territory against birds many times their size. They are often seen at backyard hummingbird feeders. **Males** have an orange back and belly and a shiny red throat. **Females** are green with rusty-red sides, rusty patches on the tail, and an orange patch on the throat.

Rufous Hummingbird are common **summer** visitors to the northwest, breeding as far north as southeastern Alaska. Some **winter** in the Gulf coast states, while others head to Mexico and Central America. Some can be found **year-round** in the southwestern United States. Migrating birds move up the Pacific coast in late spring/early winter and return south via the Rocky Mountains.

Rufous and **Allen's Hummingbird** are very difficult to tell apart. Male Allen's have a green back and rump, while the male Rufous are rusty-orange. [Ruby-throated Hummingbird](/birds/rubyhum/) have gray sides.

**Did you know?** Females begin nesting within 3 days of arriving in their summer breeding grounds. They hide their nests under drooping branches in tall trees.
