White-crowned Sparrows (6-6.5 in long) have a gray breast, a black-and-white striped head, and a pale beak. They prefer open areas with trees or shrubs nearby.

White-crowned Sparrows spend the summer in Alaska, northern Canada, and the mountains of British Columbia, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. Birds along the Pacific coast and in parts of the western interior don't migrate.

**Could it be?** [White-throated Sparrows](/birds/whitetspar/) have a white throat and a yellow patch beside their eye. [House Sparrows](/birds/houspar/), introduced to North America in 1851, are chunkier (6-6.7 in long) with a shorter tail and stouter beak.

**Did you know?** Most White-crowned Sparrows migrate at night. Females tend to winter farther south than males.
