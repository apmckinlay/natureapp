Western Meadowlarks have a **bright yellow breast** and a **black v-shaped necklace**. Their upperparts are streaky brown and black and their **round-shouldered posture** nearly conceals their neck. They are the size (6-10 in) of a [Robin](/birds/robin/) but chunkier with a shorter tail.

Western Meadowlarks spend their **summers** in the open grasslands and fields of southern Canada and the United States from the west coast as far east as the Great Lakes. They can be found **year-round** in the west-central United States. Northern birds migrate to the southern part of the range in **winter**.

Western Meadowlarks forage on the **ground** for **insects** and **seeds**. They require some cover to shield their nests so numbers have declined in intensive agricultural areas. Males sit on **fence posts** and other high points and **sing** to defend their breeding territory in **spring** and **summer**.

**Could it be?** **Eastern Meadowlarks** look very similar but have a different song and call. It can be hard to tell the two varieties apart in the midwest and south where their ranges overlap. Female [Yellow-headed Blackbirds](/birds/yellhead/) have more yellow on the head and a darker body.

**Did you know?** Male Western Meadowlarks usually have two mates at the same time, bringing food to both nests once the chicks have hatched.
