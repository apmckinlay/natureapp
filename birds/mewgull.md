Mew Gulls are **one of the smallest** (16-18 in) **white-headed** gulls. They are common along Pacific coast beaches in **winter** and can be found **year-round** along the coast of British Columbia and southern Alaska. They can be spotted in northern British Columbia and Alberta during **migration** and breed in the **summer** in Alaska, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and the far north of British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

Gulls are long-winged, white birds with gray and black markings. It can be difficult to tell them apart as they take **up to 4 years to develop their adult plumage**. In addition, gulls often mate with each other, so there are **hybrids** with characteristics of two species.

Mew Gulls have an **unmarked yellow bill**, **yellow legs**, and black wing tips with white spots.

**Did you know?** Mew Gulls often perch in [Spruce](/trees/spruce/) trees and may even build their nests in trees.
