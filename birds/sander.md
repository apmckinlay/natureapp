You're most likely to spot small flocks of Sanderlings (7-8 in) in their pale **winter** plumage - light gray above and white below with black legs and beak - chasing the waves and probing the sand for crabs and other small crustaceans on the beaches of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts.

In **summer**, Sanderlings breed on islands above the Arctic Circle on dry rocky tundra close to lakes or ponds.

**Could it be?** [Dunlin](/birds/dunlin/) are larger than Sanderlings with a longer, downcurved bill. [Piping Plover](/birds/pipplov/) are smaller, stay higher up on the beach, and don't chase waves. **Western Sandpipers** are smaller and browner than Sanderlings.

**Did you know?** After eating, Sanderlings will often regurgitate pellets of sand and mollusk and crustacean shells.
