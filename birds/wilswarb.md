Wilson's Warblers are a small warbler (4-5 in long) with a **bright yellow face** and **chest** and an **olive-green back** and **wings**. **Males** have a distinctive black cap, while **females** have varying amounts of black on top of their heads.

Wilson's Warblers **move rapidly** from perch to perch searching for **insects**, staying close to the ground and **wagging their tails** up and down. They spend their **summers** in the **mountain meadows** and **thickets near streams or lakes** of Alaska, northern Canada (all provinces); the western mountains, and the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California. They **winter** in Central America and along the coast of Texas and Louisiana.

**Could it be?** [Yellow Warbler](/birds/yellwarb/) are slightly larger with a larger bill and yellow edges to their wing feathers.

**Did you know?** Wilson's Warblers tend to be brighter yellow in the West and paler yellow in the East.
