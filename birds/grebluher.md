The Great Blue Heron is **North America's largest heron** with a wingspan of 5.5-6.5 ft. With **long legs**, **long slender neck**, and thick, dagger-like beak, they can often be seen standing motionless in shallow water looking for prey. They are **blue-gray** with a **wide black stripe above the eyes**. In flight, their wings are black and gray. They have shaggy plumes on their neck and wings during breeding season.

Great Blue Heron can be found **year-round** in both **fresh** and **saltwater** habitats of the southern United States, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island. In **summer**, they can be found in southern Canada and the central United States.

The birds build **bulky stick nests** in large **treetop colonies** with as many as 500 individual nests.

**Great White Heron**, found in southern Florida, are a sub-species of the Great Blue Heron and are  completely white. They are larger than the **Great Egret** that can also be identified by their black legs and orange beak.

**Did you know?** Great Blue Heron hold their head tucked back over their necks with their long legs trailing out behind their tail when flying. [Sandhill Crane](/{{section}}/sandhill) and [Whooping Crane](/{{section}}/whoopcrane), on the other hand, fly with their neck outstretched, and travel in groups while herons fly solo.
