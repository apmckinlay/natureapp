Great Blue Heron are **North America's largest heron** with a wingspan of 5.5-6.6 ft. With **long legs**, **long slender neck**, and thick, dagger-like beak, they can often be seen standing motionless in shallow water looking for prey. They are **blue-gray** with a **wide black stripe above the eyes**. In flight, their wings are black and gray. They have shaggy plumes on their neck and wings during breeding season.

Great Blue Heron can be found **year-round** in both **fresh** and **saltwater** habitats of the southern United States, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. In **summer**, they can be found in southern Canada and the central United States.

The birds build **bulky stick nests** in large **treetop colonies** with as many as 500 individual nests.

**Great White Heron**, found in southern Florida, are a sub-species of the Great Blue Heron and are  completely white with light-colored legs and a thick beak. **Great Egret** are smaller than the **Great White Heron** with black legs and a thinner beak.

**Did you know?** Great Blue Heron hold their head tucked back over their neck with their long legs trailing out behind their tail when flying. [Sandhill Crane](/birds/sandhill/) and [Whooping Crane](/birds/whoopcrane/), on the other hand, fly with their necks outstretched. Cranes travel in groups while herons fly solo.
