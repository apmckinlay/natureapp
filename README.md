Nature Companion App
====================

Although the intent is to create a mobile app,
initial development is as a static web site.
And we will likely have a web site version as well as the mobile app.

Since we want to work offline, the design is server-less.
Any "intelligence" will be via client-side JavaScript.

The goal is to have a responsive design
so it can be used on anything from phones to tablets to desktops.
Primarily using flexbox rather than media queries.

Trying *not* to use a lot of external libraries or frameworks.
